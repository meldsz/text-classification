But Dr. Carlos had the \"magic touch\" and I felt no pain at all and the process was over way faster than I thought it would be. Next, I came in for my cleaning and it was with Dr. Mandap. She was very friendly and after my cleaning she was very patient and took the time to answer all of the questions I had about my teeth, gums, etc. and gave me a lot of good tips on my personal dental care. The office has a cool futuristic look to it as well, and the receptionist is always accommodating. Glad I finally found a great dentist in the Scottsdale area. Thank you AZ Dental Wellness!\n",

Usually places being cheaper may be a bit skeptical but this office does inexpensive quality work. The office is clean, organized and has a great peaceful environment. I really can't thank them enough for everything they've done for us! We will definitely be back for regular cleanings and we most definitely would highly recommend their services!\n",

      "       Wow. Do not order from here. I ordered an item that was back ordered for several months. When I received it, it was the wrong item. When I called to ask them to exchange the item, they said \"Well send a picture of the item, but it's not like I'm saying you're lying.\" Seriously? Well, I still want the correct item, so I did as I was asked, even though I was called a liar, and emailed a photo of the product sent to me. I called back the next day to follow up and got the same girl \"Gabby\" on the line and a runaround like I've never been runaround. When I asked to speak with the manager, she told me the manager was busy and Gabby said she'd call me back tomorrow with an update. When I pushed to speak with the manager she hung up on me.

      "       This company is terrible! My mom purchased a portable oxygen machine from them. It was brand new and not a cheap piece of medical equipment. However, as she suffers from pulmonary hypertension she is tied to an oxygen machine 24/7. This has naturally made her depressed and often feeling trapped. This machine was the answer to our prayers. It gave her around 4 hours of being able to be out and about without concerns of running out of air. Well, the machine has broken down three times and they've yet to replace it. They \"repaired\" it but it broke two times after. At this point they should replace it. However it's been a battle to get any answers from customer service and everyone she talks to makes her a different promise. It's been nothing but stress and disappointment! Avoid buying anything from this heartless unorganized company.\n",

      "       Horrible Experience. I ordered an item and requested next day delivered. Called the company to make sure they got my order and I was getting it the next day. (What I ordered I needed in a rush for a bed ridden family member). Well, when I called the company, I was told that the charge I paid for overnight was not correct. On top of the amount their website quotes for overnight, the manufacturer also charges an additional $129. So after disputing this, we came to an agreement to deliver it in 3 days. On the second day I called to make sure that item was shipped and guess what, NOT SHIPPED. So I would not be receiving it as promised. I was told I would have to wait until the following week and they were not sure when the manufacturer would ship it out. So bottom line it would take the normal 7 to 10 days to be delivered if I was lucky. Of course this was not acceptable so I decided to cancel my order because I really needed this item ASAP. ( I ordered it from WAYFAIR excellent service.) In addition, I asked Active Forever to sent back the payment to the third party company called Affirm, which I used to pay for this Item. I was told in 2 days it should all be cleared and I would get a notice telling me my account had been cleared. Well I called Affirm 2 days later and nothing was sent to them that I had canceled my order. Now is a week and 2 days later and I called Affirm again and nothing has been sent. So I called Active Forever and I was told that they submitted the paperwork and their waiting on Affirm to respond. As you and I know that means they probably sent it today. It is really endless. The only good experience about this whole situation was speaking with Greg. He really tried with all his superiors to help me get the item on time, but unfortunately his company and the manufacturer are very irresponsible. Greg should be working with a more reliable and respectable company. Not a company who cannot deliver what they promise. Thank God for this bad experience because I found WAYFAIR, Who actually delivered and I got the item at a lower cost. They have great customer service. I highly recommend them.\n",

No way possible, as I don't know anyone at that address, so it couldn't be a default entry that went wrong. They said they would refund me. No action. Then they let me know it was returned to them by wrong recipient but I would need to wait until it reaches the warehouse for a refund. That was in May. It's now July and still nothing. I contacted them today and they said once it reaches their location I'll get a refund. I wonder if they have a bridge to sell? NEVER use this company!! Buyer beware!\n",

I measured my calf following the directions of their size chart. I tried it when it arrived but couldn't get it over my foot. I told this to the representative and he said to return it for a refund and to buy the larger size which I did. I paid for the shipping for the return and mailed the product back. It's been well over a month and I haven't heard anything or have I received a refund. I called and spoke with their representative who told me I could not return the product because it was removed from the package and tried on. I said I went by the size chart and measured my calf and followed your directions and it was too small. I also told him I've tried on wetsuits, clothes, sandals etc like everyone else from other stores and put them back on the shelf or purchased them. I am very disappointed with the customer service and the company. They give incorrect calf sizes they want you to follow and won't refund the product.\n",

Thus I was forced to order from them again to complete the item that I had wanted to begin with. But the items were shipped separately, and the second part did not arrive until 2 months later.

      "       DON\"T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. my order never arrived, i have spent over 2 weeks (3 weeks since the order) arguing with the customer service who tell me i have to wait while a claim is filed with the post office which could take weeks. Customer service man even told me i was being unreasonable not wanting to wait. I have asked numerous times for a refund which has so far been refused. rude unhelpful, they don't care if something goes wrong. You might be lucky and delivery might be ok but don't risk it, buy from another company who have better customer service. there's so many bad reviews on here for them that should be enough of a warning.\n",

They developed a hole on the third wearing. I tried to contact customer service online, but they want you to call. After lots of calling and tons of time on hold, I got a guy who coud have cared less about my defective product. He said he would follow up with me later that day. I heard from him 2 days later, via an email addressed to an unknown woman (I am a guy) referencing an entirely different order. I responded to his silly email and have not heard from anyone since. They request reviews on their web site. I have submitted two different reviews for this product. They have yet to publish either. A totally dishonest and bogus company from my standpoint. Stay away.

I too had ordered a product for a Christmas present, and was supposed to receive it in time. I didn't. After waiting for my product and not having heard from Active Forever, I finally received an email on January 7 from Amazon explaining that my product had never shipped and they are not going to charge my account. Thank god for Amazon. I contacted Active Forever and they informed me they had run out of the product and won't be receiving any more until the end of January. Awesome, thanks. Their customer service was a joke. Unresponsive, short, and NOT helpful. The name of the \"Key Accounts Manager\" was Debbie Dollar...I don't care who handles my account, and I understand there are woman (maybe even men) with the name Debbie Dollar, but this seems like a fictitious name for a \"Key Accounts Manager\". Have some accountability for yourself and your business. Maybe \"Ivan Inventory\" should have done a better job ensuring the product I wanted was available. Ps. This is my first review. I've had some bad experiences in my past, but this is the one that propelled me to create a YELP account and write a review.\n",

      "       I found ActiveForever after a family incident. I was in a panic and not in a great mood, when I called ActiveForever. I needed some things for my Father after he took a fall. I found products on other sites (like one named after a giant river in South America :)) -- but have you tried calling one of those sites to ask for advise -- not going to happen...The staff at ActiveForever was really knowledgable and helped me get some things that helped my Dad get out of bed (by himself), get to the bathroom and take care of business. I don't what I'd do without those things. I'm glad they helped me pick out the correct things as I found out that most toilet and bed products are not returnable. I certainly can understand that! (YECK!). They also have some other really unique products. I ordered a few things as Christmas gifts -- thinga I didn't even know existed until I surfed around the site a bit. People invent the darndest things. The only complaint I have is that some items don't have free shipping -- however, when I compared the price with shipping to other sites with free shipping it was still cheaper at ActiveForever. Apparently they don't gouge you on the price only to give so called \"free shipping\" - no such thing as a free lunch as they say...\n",

      "       I recently purchased a cool-hot mattress pad, as I suffer from terrible hot flashes and thought this would be the ideal solution. I was a little wary about the motor part attached to it and wondered how noisy it would be. When I received it, I took the motor part out of the box and turned it on ... it was terribly noisy, even though it said on-line that it was \"quiet\". There is no way I could sleep through this noise, so I called to return it. I was told I could not return the product as it was a \"hygiene product\". Even though it was never out of the box, I cannot return it. Now I read about their lousy return policies ... I wish I had seen them before, I would NEVER have dealt with them. The company sucks, big time. I have seen the identical product on other on-line sites and they have a 30-day return guarantee, so if THEY can do it, why can't ActiveForever?

      "       If I could leave zero stars I would. I'll keep this as brief as possible even though it's not been brief at all. 1. They shipped me the wrong item. 2. When I contacted them on a thursday they said they would send the right item. I asked if it would arrive by Xmas (it was a present) and they said they would check and call me back. They never called. 3. I emailed the following Monday- no response. 4. Called late Tuesday. Was told by a manager he couldn't access my record and the person who didn't call NE back Thursday would call me back. She actually did this time. 5. They hadn't sent the right item the prior week so I was told it would go out the next day (Wednesday- I had to have it by Thursday). I told them to forget it and cancel the order. They insisted that they still send me a return label so that I didn't have to pay for the return of the wrong item. 6. Two days later no label. I called again and asked to speak to a manager. I was sent to the voicemail of the person who has been delinquent. Called back and got a manager who said I should receive the label later that afternoon. 7. It's now six days after the call where they said they would send the label and guess what?! NO LABEL! I cannot conceive how at every single step in this process they have managed to perform poorly. Now I have the added aggravation of seeing their web ads every time I'm on the Internet. Because I purchased something there I guess their advertising is following me. This would be a good strategy if it didn't constantly remind me of the terrible service I received which led me to post this review.\n",

      "       I got off work early one day &amp; thought to get my alcohol card since I had some time left in the day. My friends recommended this place to me, but I wasn't sure if they took walk ins! I called &amp; luckily they do!They have classes M-F at 9am and 2pm. This was my first time having to take an alcohol certification class and I was a bit nervous because I didn't know the process or if I had to take a test at the end, etc. I'm glad I came here because the instructor was very kind and he brought his cute dog Lucky. I loved how personable the instructor was and how fast the course was. Make sure to bring $20 cash, unless you want to walk to the bar behind the building to use their atm lol. You can also take a course on their website and pick up your alcohol card there. I believe it's $15 that way. I'll be recommending this place to my friends that need to get their alcohol cards!\n",

As soon as you walk in he instructs you to grab a piece of paper and fill out your information. When I walked to his desk to give him my paper I was about to turn back around to take my seat and he said \"come here!\" he instructed me to have a seat so that a woman could take my photo. I felt my face get red because I don't like to be spoken to that way and he embarrassed me in front of the others. After that he made a sexist comment/joke to a woman who was holding the remote to a tv he has in the classroom. Once he started the class he made a remark about everyone who would approach the class after it had started because he could see them walking toward the door from the inside and he thought it was funny to criticize them in front of the others.

But all this cards are required by law at my work so there's no way out. There are about 3 or 4 certified schools in Nevada where you can obtain this card, you have to attend the three to four hour class depending on the school and pay the 20 to 40 dollar fee, again depending on the school. By far this is the best place to obtain the card the instructor is very knowledgeable on the subject and very understanding with the students. The price of the card is only 20.00 dollars. The class is very easy and the only way not to pass the class is if you come to the class drunk and that would be funny because that would mean that you needed the class the most. You will learn that drinking alcohol causes drunkenness, and will receive a card to prove that you actually know that. The hardest part would be to stay awake.\n",

The time clocked in at just barely under 30min and the ladies tag teamed my gf and I. At one point one of the ladies just up and quit on my gf stating she \"was done\" and then left w out finishing the rest of the service on my gf leaving one girl between the both of us. They rush you in and steamroll through the service putting no quality into it because they're more worried about the volume of customers than they are about caring for the customer. They do a good job at making you feel like you're an inconvenience that should be giving them more money for less service and customer care. Had there been any sort of manager on duty I would've voiced my concern with the poor service and tried to reach a price agreement that was fair for everyone. As it was though, there were only two therapists whose command of the English language wasn't very good except when it comes to asking for money. I would say avoid this place unless you find some strange satisfaction in feeling pissed off and cheated.\n",

In the room, I was questioned about why I just wanted a foot massage. Begrudgingly, the lady said \"ok.\" I then got a 5-minute foot soak, followed by a 20-minute foot rub and a 5-minute shoulder rub. What was really bad though was that 10 minutes into it, a second lady came in and said (as best I could understand), \"We're really slow. I'll give you special treatment - all over body.\" I told her I just wanted the foot massage. She said, \"It's okay. We take care of you\" and started rubbing me in a very rough way. It's like she had no training in massage whatsoever. At the end, I was asked for another $35! It's no wonder the place was empty. Stay away from this place. The ladies are scam artists.\n",

I have worked with many Physical Therapists during the course of my life. Ed is technically among the best and his concern and care for his patients is amazing.

      "       The BEST experience I have ever had at the dentist!!! :D :D :D I was greeted by the very pleasant front desk staff, and only had to wait 5 minutes before getting into a chair and starting my X-Rays / Initial Exam. I returned a few weeks later to get 4 fillings with Dr. Zunaid Jamal. He is an incredibly upbeat and kind person, and he does INCREDIBLE work, along with the rest of his staff. I didn't feel a single needle go in or ANY pain during the entire process, and my bite is now corrected!! (I grind my teeth apparently and my bite was a tad off. Not anymore though.. Yay!) I highly recommend this place to anyone who is put off by needles or any kind of pain at the dentist. It is non-existent here!! I will recommending all of my friends to switch to Arch, as this place is leaps and bounds beyond the rest, and I always leave happy. :) Thanks so much, guys! You're the best!\n",

      "       I have had such a fantastic experience at this dental office. It has taken me some time to find a dentist in Toronto that I like. I have done a lot of trials...cleanings at different dentist offices and meeting the dentists and have had some very poor experiences. Arch Liberty Dental is AMAZING. The receptionists are knowledgeable and very helpful. They are open in the evenings and on Saturdays to accommodate those of us who don't have flexible work schedules. Megan, my hygienist was very good - knowledgeable, caring, detailed, thorough and did not hurt me! Probably my best cleaning experience ever! Dr. Jamal was funny, informative and I truly think he cared about me and my teeth! He gave me an entire lesson on my teeth - I have complete confidence that he is the right guy to take care of me. I'm not a big fan of the dentist - i hate getting any work done in my mouth but I believe these guys are going to take care of me. My appointment was almost 2 hours long but I left feeling fantastic. It was such a good experience. And it was nice that I was not being rushed out - every single person at Arch Liberty Dental took their time to make sure I was comfortable for this entire experience. I would recommend them with flying colors to everyone!!!\n",

And they've been extremely generous to me as a patient as well as caring, kind and compassionate. You can't beat their prices they've definitely come down since the beginning and are definitely competitive with other dispensaries in the area. I would advise checking them out and keeping them on your shortlist definitely worth it if you're a medical patient have your card in the state of Arizona.

      "       Really great place but this last week I've called in every day to see if I had a chance of getting shatter medicine concentrates, and each day they tell me that they get three deliveries a day and somehow within the 10 minutes that I call and arrive and waste my gas they are putting up a sign or sold out. Before committing to this long drive I called in to ensure that there was a possibility of having shatter which today was confirmed by the gentleman who answered the phone but within those 10 minutes they sold out. Now I totally understand that businesses naturally can sell out of product ... But within such a short period of time someone was either lacking common sense in providing a proper answer or they did not care and expected that I would purchase something anyways... This is been a problem for me.. And I am now going to stop coming because it's a waste of gas and time when people are trying to find relief. I hope you guys fix it being that you are the leading dispensary and concentrates otherwise people like myself I'll start catching on...great job\n",

      "       I cannot give five stars because I have no other location with which to compare this one. I can say for myself, however, that not having been to another dispensary is of no consequence. I have fallen for AZO and have no intentions at this moment of finding another location: Location for AZO, in my opinion, is pretty great. Right on the edge of downtown Glendale, so if you're looking for a good eat and some unique local shops close by, you can take a look around before heading in to make your purchase. The facility itself is immaculate. The floors are always polished and the smell isn't too strong (though it's obvious that it's there). The displays are always clean which is big for me. The staff is professional and courteous, always willing to answer any questions or provide any personal insight they may have on a product in which you may be interested. There is a point reward system for those who are store-loyalists (and like free shit) like me. I can't really speak much on pricing, because like I mentioned, I haven't been anywhere else. But I've read a fair amount of reviews on pricing and quality and it seems I've made the best choice. AZO is by no means the closest dispensary to me, but it is worth the drive absolutely every time. And for those who may have any misconceptions about what a place like this may be like? There is a security guard who will walk you from your car to the front door. Parking is fenced and the only entrance/exit to the (dirt) lot is past this guard. It's discreet, it's clean, professionalism is paramount, good loyalty rewards...what more could you want from a dispensary? AZO is my place and I've recommended them to everyone I know with a green card.\n",

      "       I was searching for a new dentist in town -- a place with flexible hours. I went in late last month for a check up and cleaning. Altogether, it took a little over an hour. The atmosphere was nice, clean and they had modern equipment compared to what I have seen. The staff were kind and provided preventive information. My appointment began with completing new patient paperwork, followed with X-rays. What stood out to me was when they had me test a new Oral B electric toothbrush. I had never used one before so it was a neat experience, and it saved them from needing to brush my teeth (what I'm used to getting at a cleaning). I rated the electric toothbrush and noted who prepped it for me. They told me it could be purchased in their office, then had the dentist review my X-rays. This part was nice because the images were displayed on a monitor in front of me and the he explained what he saw to me--no concerns (whew!). Following that, I reviewed my charges before wrapping up my cleaning. My insurance covered the X-rays and cleaning, and there were additional charges for the electric toothbrush (which I thought was interesting and opted not to get) and a topical fluoride. I didn't expect to pay that much out of pocket, but since I slacked on dental maintenance for the last couple years, said what the hey with it. Overall, it was an good experience and I got what I needed done.\n",

Insurance has since informed me that this was incorrect, and that Aspen charged me even though the insurance had covered the full price. Aspen also listed the wrong tooth to be filled, tried and failed to fill it two full times before managing it (causing me to leave 30 mins after they promised me I would be out), and my teeth still hurt almost a month after the basic cleaning. I've been to the dentist twice a year for most of my life and have never encountered such incompetent dentistry. I now understand why people hate the dentist.

The x-rays were developed in a back room and were not shown to me. I was told I had multiple cavities and I thought it was strange because I had X-rays a year or so ago and was cavity free. I got a second opinion and was told I have absolutely no cavities and so this dentist lied to me. I did some research and dentists can \"drill a hole\" and refill it so it looks like there was a cavity there when actually there could not have been. After this procedure no one will know that you did not have a cavity. Please do your research and be careful before you trust everything they say.\n",

The lady I spoke with was very courteous and helpful and got me in. The front office guy was friendly and efficient. The office itself was simple, clean and tidy. (I don't care much for overly fancy offices; they make me wonder how much of what I pay are for the bells and whistles.) The thing that made me really happy was that after Dr. Acosta examined the tooth I was complaining about, he dictated to his assistant to note the problems and refer me to another specialist for RCT and other things. I then explained that I was actually wanting to have it completely removed. I was bracing for a speech on how it's not the best option, etc. but instead he just asked, \"Are you sure you want to lose this tooth?\" When I said I just don't want to have to think about it anymore, he gladly obliged and took note of the fact that I had already let go of another molar before. He completely respected my wishes and I'm so thankful. I'll be going back for the actual extraction and will update this review IF anything changes my view of this office. For now, it's highly recommended!\n",

      "       I am recently new to the area after being gone for about 10 years, so I chose Dr. Acosta because of the great reviews &amp; rating... He and the rest of the staff/practice certainly do live up to the excellent reviews!! I can't emphasize enough just HOW much I dislike visiting the dentist. However, Dr. Acosta and his staff made me feel really confident &amp; comfortable in their care. I am really impressed. Having some bothersome tooth pain, I decided to schedule my annual cleaning &amp; exam with them, too. When I called to make my appointment, the gentleman on the phone was very kind and thorough in gathering information. I ended up having to call back two days later saying my tooth pain could not wait another week, and they were able to squeeze me in promptly that afternoon for Dr. Acosta to take a look and set me up with some relief until we could analyze the damage &amp; take further action. Dr. Acosta and his staff were incredibly helpful &amp; caring. They really treated you like you matter! He was able to find some damage causing the abrupt pain, even went to the effort of showing me and explaining in depth WHY this was an issue and causing my discomfort, along with what may be the best route for treatment. Assured me we would get this taken care of following my comprehensive exam &amp; cleaning. And for someone who reallllllly does not like going to the dentist- for once, I have great peace of mind going back and am very confident in their work &amp; care. I really appreciated being treated so well as a patient, and them taking the time to squeeze me in, knowing that tooth pain can be really awful to deal with. I can't thank them enough or stress just how welcome and taken care of they made me feel. I would certainly recommend this practice to anyone, and I look forward to receiving my dental care from Dr. Acosta and his staff.\n",

I was unable to reach my dentist at the time and started calling around. Dr. Acosta promptly returned my call and rescued me. I'm so glad I found them! The staff is wonderful, very helpful and treat you like family. Dr. Acosta is innovative, (my teeth aren't easy to work with because I am a grinder and he was able to help me). I still need more work done and I will continue to go to Dr. Acosta. I had a cleaning today(visit number 4), and I must say it was one of the most thorough cleanings I can recall having!

He then provide excessent trigger point and deep tissue massage which provided me with much needed pain relief. He also suggested methods of after care to avoid further inflaming of the injury. I would highly recommend Joel. Knowledgeable, approachable, and professional\n",

      "       Watch out for this hustler. Similar experience than the other review. We arrived late because of the terrible location. Its on Tropicana but you have to turn off another street to actually get to the location. Either way we arrived - couples massage. They worked on us without asking any questions about the type of massage and at the end slapped us with a $180 bill. $90 for a 35 minute massage. You have to be kidding me. I understand I came late but I also wasnt expecting to be taken advantage of. On the website a swedish massage is less. $90 is for thier special in which I obviously didnt realize I had gotten. For that amount, you are better off getting a massage on the strip. At least there would be facilities to use. This place is a one room shop studio in a building with 20 other suites. Thin walls. Poor location. Sadly the massage was actually decent but I would never return or recommend due to the customer service. Way over priced as an overall experience.\n",

Totally her massage time is 15 minus less then one and half hour she charge me! Not worth at all.\n",

She did a great job with hotstone/deep tissue/therapy massages &amp; was always professional. I always left her place feeling relaxed &amp; happy. The only cons were her location was further out and it was hard to get an appointment so, I suggest you to make an appointment well in advance. Perhaps, I will stop in oneday when I feel like it. ;-) Her price was about $100/hr/person + we tipped her like $20 from ea of us.\n",

      "       Rochelle is completely committed to her clients. There are very few people or places I write a repeat review for. Today, my husband called on my behalf, because I could not move and was in severe pain, Rochelle was able to squeeze me in by sacrificing her own family time. I do not trust anyone but her to give me a massage. Immediate she knew what my problem was. Prior to my session, I was not able to move my neck more that 30 degrees each way, but by the time my session was over I was 90% and remainder just requires rest, time, and stretching. Again, Rochelle has a good understanding of muscles, occupational function, and anatomy. Her ability to listen to your needs and her understanding of anatomy, makes her massages truly therapeutic. You will feel the long lasting, positive effects of her massages, which is the true value. If you are looking for some fru-fru decor \"off-the-strip\" \"luxury spa deal than you might be disappointed, but if you are looking genuine care and real massage experience, then you must meet Rochelle, she will positively change your expectations of a massage. Rochelle is sweet and genuinely caring, but also a professional masseuse. She is dynamic in her abilities and very attentive to your specific needs. I know once you experience her massage technique, the bar will be raised.\n",

      "       I had a deep tissue massage by Rochelle Campo and it was AMAZING. I have had many massages over the years, but Rochell was easily the greatest masseuse of them all. She is highly skilled in finding areas of need and working out knots, tension, and tightness until they are just gone. She was not afraid to work my body as much as it needed, to 'fix' the problem, yet she was still sensitive to how much I could handle. In addition to a mind-blowing massage, the environment was lovely, Rochell has a very relaxed and calming demeanor, and the price was reasonable considering the experience, but she is not cheap.

      "       My boyfriend surprised me with a couples massage this past weekend in Vegas. I will admit I was a little skeptical when we pulled up to a strip mall away from the main strip. However, we drove and had our own car so the distance wasn't an issue. Once we were inside the tiny space that is Boracay Massage, both Rochelle and Max (i think that was his name) began their magic we were transported to a place of sheer relaxation! Both masseuses were professional and had hands of magic. The 90 minute Swedish therapeutic hot stone massage blew our expectations. The drive is worth it to get away from the inflated prices at the resorts and I bet the service is much better. My boyfriend and I have confirmed we will be back every time we visit Vegas. Disclosure: If you are looking for a fancy posh spa with all the works this isn't for you, but if you want a phenomenal massage in a professional atmosphere Boracay is for you!\n",

      "       My experience with Boracay was excellent. I was on vacation with the wife for our Anniversary and part of the day involved a couples massage at another location. When that salon cancelled on us (!) I was left scrounging for another place. Boracay to the rescue. They fit us in in a mid-week afternoon slot which happened to be the day of our actual anniversary date which was perfect! The studio fit just right for our package and I was more than happy with the massage and aromatherapy. They had a special for couples and for $140 we both got an excellent 60-minute massage and aromatherapy. They cater to you and what you want/don't want and try their best to make you as relaxed as possible. Loved it.\n",

      "       If you are looking for a new dentist I strongly recommend Bridgeland Dental Care. This is an affordable, state-of-the-art dental office with the friendliest staff I have ever encountered. I found this place when I was shopping around for a dentist whose rates were as close as possible to those of my insurance company. Since switching dentists I have cut hundreds of dollars off of my family's dental bills. Savings aside, this place is fantastic. The lobby is pleasant, the receptionists are always friendly and ready to help in any way. Actually, the entire staff seem to be delighted to work there and with each other, and their good mood is contagious. Every dental chair is equipped with a flat screen TV and headphones so that you can watch TV during your dental work. They also use the TVs to display your dental x-rays (this place does digital x-rays, I have never seen such a large picture of my own teeth before). The dentist, Dr. Laura Brescia, is friendly, professional, and easy to talk with. She and all of the hygienists take extra care with explaining each of the procedures and do their best to make you as comfortable as possible. Situated in one of the newer condos in Bridgeland their office is a couple of doors down from Starbucks. Free two-hour parking is readily available in behind the condos, but pay attention to the signs - one block requires payment, but the next block does not. If you are looking for a new dentist then give these guys a call to see if it meets your needs. I'm very glad that I did.\n",

      "       This review is long overdue. I had the incredible fortune of having Dr. Brad Briggs as my dentist during an all-too-brief period of time while I was living in Phoenix. Within a few months, Dr. Brad fixed three significant dental issues for me, which had resulted from some unfortunate past dental work (performed by one downright vicious NYC dentist and one very good NYC dentist who was limited by her 20th-century technology). Briggs Dentistry has well-trained and friendly staff and employs CAD/CAM and other current technology, which makes a HUGE difference when dealing with anything beyond a regular teeth cleaning. It has now been 5 (!) years since Dr. Brad took care of my teeth, and, thanks to his fabulous work and some great advice from one of his staff members (Cindy, I believe), I have had zero dental problems since then. When I moved back East, it turned out to be surprisingly difficult to find a dentist who compares to Dr. Briggs, and we are talking about NYC, which is saturated with all sorts of dentists. After very seriously considering the unrealistic idea of visiting Phoenix regularly for dental appointments, I eventually found a terrific NYC dentist who uses current technology and whose office has the same friendly and non-pushy vibe I experienced at Briggs Dentistry. Because it was so oddly difficult to find my current NYC dentist, I can say without hesitation that if Dr. Brad opened a Briggs Dentistry branch in New York, he would be the toast of the town.\n",

      "       Woke up this morning with a sore jaw and a blister feeling thing that there was no reason for. I'm unhappy with previous dentist so called Briggs office I heard a radio advertisement for. They had an opening so I rushed off to the office at the appointed time. Told Dr. Briggs I was hoping to hear \"there isn't a problem, go back to work.\" Instead he said it's fortunate you noticed this so quickly. Going to see a specialist next week. I'll count my blessings, but ignoring the problem would have been cheaper - for a few days. The digital X-ray is really cool. Film thing has a wire on it. X-ray appears on the monitor in a few seconds. Be sure to tell them Mike Broomhead from KFYI radio sent you. My initial exam fee was waved. Not sure how much longer that special will be valid, but it really helped me.\n",

      "       I do not recommend Dr. Roger Briggs. I encountered many of the issues Mathew in the review below did. I had been going to Dr. Briggs for about 2 years and just mainly had cleanings and maybe one filling. I found an issue shortly after my most recent cleaning and checkup that he failed to bring to my attention. I had x-rays done and everything. To me, this is negligent and could have turned into a much larger and more costly problem. Maybe that is what he was hoping for. I care about my teeth and am all about preventative care. I made an appointment for him to look at the issue he missed. I waited in the waiting room for 45 minutes after my appointment time without any acknowledgement from anyone that they were running late. I would have much rather them called me ahead of time to let me know they were running behind since I had to leave work for the appointment. Dr. Briggs did not care that I had to wait so long, but instead told me that he has a lot of out of town patients and was basically saying they are more important. Once the appointment began, he did not like that I was asking questions and did not care that he missed the small hole in my tooth. I am assuming a piece of my filling chipped off, but I couldn't get any answers or insight on that. I asked why it wasn't brought to my attention when I was just there, but couldn't get an answer on that either. Instead, he just said that it seems like I have lost faith in him so I should find another dentist. Over the course of my two year treatment I found myself doing a lot of my own research and bringing concerns up to him, instead of the other way around. I also had issues with them telling me insurance covered things such as a mouth guard, but found out after it was all said and done, they did not so I had to come up with the money for it. Perhaps Dr. Briggs is worn out and needs to retire. I would pass on this Dentist if I was you.\n",

      "       Have been going to Briggs for a few years after finding them as being highly rated. Did appreciate a lot of the work and care the provided. Had questions on a cap or onlay in regards to preserving as much of the tooth as possible. Dr Briggs said he didn't understand my questions and that they meant nothing to him. He said said he didn't want to do the work and suggested I go somewhere else. Had issues with his younger son getting frustrated about questions in the past as well. Have been to enough doctors to know that the good ones are happy to discuss procedure and options, the ones that don't are usually ones to avoid. Liked the staff and even the dentists, billing was ok but not perfect. These folks seem to be out of their comfort zone doing anything more complicated than a filling, as demonstrated by acts of arrogance and frustration with simple questions. I do not recommend Briggs Dentistry.\n",

Dr. Roger Briggs was beyond helpful, professional, and went well above and beyond in my dental care. I came to this practice after a horrible experience with another dentist in Anthem who gave me what I later found out to be an unnecessary crown on my back molar. Not only was it not necessary but three years later I found out just how horrible a job she did mining my tooth down which left no tooth structure for a crown. My options were an extraction with an oral surgeon or root canal and pin, but my case was not without complication and risk higher than normal because of the extreme curvature of my roots. Dr. Briggs meet with me and my husband a few times to discuss my options in detail, he called me, and even gave his cell phone number if I had any further questions or concerns. He is a conservative doctor who is truly concerned with the overall health of his patients and their long term dental care. He gave me sound advice and did a superb job! I have also had a great experience with the front office staff and the hygienist. Dr. Briggs is highly credentialed, and I would highly recommend this practice!\n",

      "       I have been coming here for 2+ years. This review replaces my past negative review. Today I had a difficult crown and 2 fillings. Now, my mouth does ache a little, but not too bad. I have dental ANXIETY. Big time. They give me dark glasses, a neck roll, and a video to watch. Hate the sound of the drill, etc. Dr. Roger did the work today, and in the past Dr. Brad did everything. Serena is such a sweet gentle soul, she is my hygenist. I am glad I stayed with these dentists. Thanks so much for the almost painless visits.\n",

      "       I don't get the chance to go into the Briggs dental office as much as I'd like because I'm from out of town but my experiences there have been awesome. When I was in school my friend and I were using his parents place in AZ to study for board exams over a break. Well, just my luck, I broke my front tooth. My friends parents said they have been going to see the Briggs for years so I gave them a call. Thankfully they were able to get me in right away. Dr. Roger told me that my tooth was in pretty bad shape and needed a cap to fix it up. I guess these things take awhile because they have to be made by a lab outside of the office. I was only going to be in town for another week but Dr. Briggs called in a favor and got the cap back in half the time. The fix looks great and has held up for years. I still travel to AZ from time to time and I schedule dental appointments with them when I can because I like them so much. Dr. Roger and Dr. Brad are awesome and couldn't recommend them more. They are always having a good time but are also very professional. Dr. Brad is very conscientious of my dental phobia and actually has my laughing by the time I leave (which was very rare before I met them, something about the dentist office normally freaks me out). Serina, one of the hygienists, is great. She never chastises me for my lack of flossing and is very gentle. She is actually Dr. Rogers daughter and Dr. Brads sister so this is a true family practice. Wish I lived in AZ sometimes...\n",

      "       The sad part is I USED to give them a 5 star rating. I USED to tell my friends and family to go there. I USED to love them so much!!! But here is what they have been doing the last few appointments and I just can't stand it. You make an appointment with the hygienist you have come to love and respect. This person was like a friend and you didn't even mind getting your teeth cleaned and I HATE the dentist. But now what they do is make you see a tech first. So now your talented and wonderful hygienist only comes in for the last 5 minutes and cleans up their work. My experience was the tech was no where near as gentle and calming. I HATE IT. HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT. I make an appointment and drive 20 miles to see the HYGIENIST, not a tech. I am so very very heart broken. I am currently looking for a new dentist. I am going to miss them so very much but if I only get to see the hygienist for 5 minutes it is not worth it. I am back to being scared to go to my appointments and stress over them for days. I just wish they would go back to how it was!\n",

      "       WARNING: LONG but THOROUGH review! :-) I've visited Briggs Family Dentistry twice now; originally chose them based on prior reviews and the fact they've been received multiple \"Top Dentists\" awards (\"Top Docs\" edition of Phoenix magazine is where I first learned of them). Rates are on the pricey end, but are competitive for the Scottsdale area and are accompanied by an amazing (dare I say \"unbeatable\") experience. If you need extensive or pricey work done like me (two crowns), they also do what they can to aid in the financial department (payment plans, cash discount) which is great for those of us who don't have dental insurance. I love that they do NOT have high pressure sales but simply - honestly - state what kind of work you'll need or can expect in the future. They also do NOT recommend unnecessary treatments, as I've experienced with every other dentist (i.e. \"you should get whitening, this 'might' be a cavity so let's fill it,\" etc). My front teeth are sensitive to cold. Additionally, I've always dreaded the flossing part which proves painful. BUT BOTH visits to Briggs resulted in 100% pain-free cleanings! They also offer laughing gas if anxiety is an issue. I've seen both of the Briggs (Dr. Roger and Dr. Bradley) and was pleased with each - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree! From the front desk to the tech to the doctors to the billing/checkout, EVERY staff member was incredibly *sincerely* kind, patient, and extraordinary. Both my husband and I have never experienced anything like it... and being that my hubby is Jamaican (black), this says something, especially in North Scottsdale where (sadly) there is racism. Briggs Family Dentistry is reminiscent of businesses in a time past - something that is so rare, so unseen now days. As long as this persists, I can guarantee my hubby and I will be life-long patients! In fact, today I scheduled for a crown I need, and cavity filings for the hubby. A final note: the true mark of a great businessman is his involvement in the community and willingness to give back (pro bono work); the doctors Briggs are regularly involved in both, locally and worldly. :-)\n",

My apt was at 2pm and I wasn't seen by an actual dentist until 3. And then he measured my teeth very hastily and then left me alone in a dental chair for 45 minutes! No one came by to check on me whatsoever and I could hear dental hygienists laughing and messing around the workplace. By the time he came back he tells me that he can't do the cleaning because they were nearing closing time. So I basically wasted 2 hours of my life for nothing.

      "       I came here to see an oral surgeon after being in pain for a week. My experience was awful. First they charged me $430.00 with insurance for one tooth extraction plus sedation. The staff before hand was not at all comforting or reassuring as I was extremely nervous. Then I went back to meet the oral surgeon. He did not introduce himself and honestly gave the impression he had better things to do. He then explained he would not be able to put me under sedation because of having a short airway. He did not throughly explain the situation, or offer other solutions. I ended up leaving the office and going to another oral surgeon who only charged me $156.00 and that was actually for two teeth to be extracted plus sedation. This office is horrible, not only is the staff rude but it's a total rip off. Go elsewhere!!!\n",

I really worried that something had happened to my gums, as I never imagined a DOCTOR would run a scam!! Fortunately I didn't fall for it.

      "       Beware - SCAM! - Deceptive shady practices You may be lured in by an offer of $29 for a cleaning / inspection / xray as I was. After you arrive, you are processed quickly, x-rays are taken effectively, and staff are pleasant -but that's where the fun ends. A dentist will come and \"inspect\" you, which of course, no mouth is perfect. You will be pushed into other services hard. You will decline because you know you are an adult, and you do not want braces. This isn't your first time to the dentist after all, you're aware what needs work. Then you are told, congratulations, you have no cavities. Then you are told they will come back to you with a breakdown for your cleaning. Then instead of $29, you are told it will be $191 per quadrant (x4) = $764 or something to this effect. Why? Because an \"advanced\" cleaning is necessary. You ask, well, can I just have the basic cleaning? You are told no, you cannot, because you need the advanced. Really? So the basic would do me no good you ask? They say, no, then you are given a very bad analogy that makes no sense. Then they ask if you want to go ahead, and you say, um, no thanks. They ask if you want a copy of the paper work, and you'll likely say, no thanks, I'm never coming back. I have little patience for scams like this. Don't make claims or offers and then not stand behind them. I'm most annoyed I drove there &amp; wasted my time, and the worst thing is, I should have known better - any dentist with windows overlooking the beautiful ambiance of the Carl's Jr. parking lot can't be that good can it? Beware, AVOID AT ALL COSTS, DO NOT GO - go to a reputable dentist who is upfront and doesn't play scam games.\n",

He is gentle when testing for injuries or other health issues. He is conservative with treatment but thorough. As an RN I appreciate this because I understand the damage that is done by Drs who over treat with too much medications, radiation etc. He has always been willing to discuss a plan of care. I have always felt like he cares and chooses the right treatment. He also explains his findings well. His office staff are courteous, efficient and professional. Several staff members have been there for many years. Calls are returned in a reasonable time. I always recommend Dr Shockey to friends and family. *****\n",

Never mind that I've been on it for 10 yrs and to ME it has been a life saver. He said my dosage (40mg) is way too much because the standard dose is 10mg (not true). A Dr can have opinions of prescriptions, but Dr Shockey was a complete jerk. A good dr takes the time to talk to a patient before deciding whether a drug may be good for them. He did say he'd consider it if I got records for him (which I had with me) but I couldn't get out of his office fast enough. No thanks!\n",

      "       I have been going to this practice for close to 10 years! Dr. Shockey used to be amazing! He still very nice and professional, but doesn't seem to care about all the negative reviews on his front office! I went in for a billing question and was asked to state my question at the front desk (in front of all patients in the waiting room). Never did I get asked if I'd like to speak about it in private! I then was told \"it is what it is there's really no questions to be asked\". I've also left multiple multiple voicemails and received a call back once. Billing department is horrible! Very unprofessional and not personable at all!!! Very unsatisfied with their customer service lately! Can never get a hold of any doctors or nurses even if you try 100 times! Front office is very rude and snobby on the phone as well as in person! My family and I will be searching for a new PCP!\n",

      "       Apparently this practice is run by the \"ladies\" at the front desk. When asking for one of the two head practice doctors, the \"ladies\" transferred me to a billing clerk. Ugh. Calls to my primary care physician brought no return call. (Did the doctor even get that message? I think not.) Letters to the physicians listed in the Arizona Cororation Commission's files, that showed the practice incorporated in 2005, went unanswered. My spouse thought that knowing this about the office operation, it was best to leave their practice. Believe it or not, it was \"these ladies\" who messed up. After all, they are not selling shoes and socks. They are a health care provider with human beings as their revenue source. You, me, my family and friends could be at risk with this type of goings on. Together my spouse and I concluded that the doctors have no idea what is going on, and the so-called \"ladies\" may be vendictive, meaning not properly taking care of patients. Who would know? Would you want to do business with a family medical office that seems not to care? I don't. This post was entered in August. It is now mid October. Letters to the doctors who own the practice have gone unanswered. Is this a way to run a health care facility? Are the front desk \"ladies\" still in charge of your health? I think so. It's time to clean house.\n",

      "       I think those who have rated this one star haven't been to a doctor's office that is truly one star. The office staff has always been very professional to me (they weren't overly friendly though, but I'm okay with that). I have been in many times, and I have never had a long wait time. With a family care doctor though, I'm sure there are certain times of the year, especially during cold and flu season, when they have to over book because everyone is getting sick all at once (otherwise instead of people complaining about waiting, they'd be complaining about the office scheduling appointments days out when they need to be seen immediately). I've seen Dr. Shockey and Dr. Bruce. I am not an easy patient. I have several medical conditions that require me to see a specialists on a regular basis, but I really needed a primary care doctor to be the central location that everything gets funneled through. This is where I ended up going. Dr. Shockey has very strong opinions and can be a bit brash. He's very analytical and data oriented. He's involved in the medical community and clinical trials. There are opinions he's had that I have not agreed with, but I never felt undermined when I voiced my concerns, especially when it's a controversial topic within the medical community. If you know you can't handle a doctor with very strong opinions, I would recommend Dr. Bruce. His communication style is a lot softer than Dr. Shockey's. You can have your blood work done in office which is so nice. That has saved me so much time alone. I don't want to go into the details of my medical issues, but they are very competent doctors who have gone out of their way several times for my benefit. One day they squeezed me in just hours after I had called. I had a terrible headache that wouldn't go away. Worst headache I've ever had. Dr. Bruce saw me. He picked up on some neurological symptoms I was completely unaware of. He became alarmed and spoke with Dr. Shockey to get his opinion. I guess I was a little out of their league, so he called a neurologist he's friends with to get an immediate opinion. When it was apparent I needed an MRI immediately, the staff called my insurance to figure out how the process would work. They didn't have to do that, but they did. I know I made both of those doctors late for the rest of their patients that day. I'm glad they were willing to spend the extra time on me. This isn't the only occasion they've done that. Overall, I've been very happy with my medical care.\n",

Average wait times are very long; sometimes more then an hour. After wasting an hour or more in the waiting room, the doctors run you through very quickly.

Every single time, they could not get the insurance billed correctly. Every claim from their services was kicked back by TriCare due to improperly billed services. I would literally have to call the office manager and \"remind\" them that BCBS is primary and TriCare is secondary for every single encounter that I had with them.

When I explained that I had been called and had set up the appointment through the caller, I was told they use a third party advertiser and they had not set up the appointment.

Not only is the front office staff attentive communicative and knowledgeable the chiropractors here are efficient and experts in their trade. as the daughter and sister of a chiropractor I honestly would not trust anyone else with these weekly adjustments. I am so thankful to have them as part of my team as I begin my first pregnancy. I get an adjustment a week and I have not had one ache or pain throughout my pregnancy and they were even able to advise me on postpartum issues. I truly look forward to staying with this team for as long as possible and would not recommend anyone else in the valley besides them!!\n",

My mom was in a lot of pain and felt better after the adjustment. Dr. Garrett was very professional and interactive. He taught me what was happening and what's the problem is and how he's going to fix it. If it's out of his capability he will refer her but thanksfully from the x-ray it appears to be muscle-skeletal problem which he's very expert in re-aligning the bones :).

      "       I only write reviews for businesses that I've had a good experience at because I've seen what can happen to a business if they have a poor online reputation. I hope this stays on this page because I genuinely had a great experience here. I also am a grateful person in general and when I see someone working hard, I appreciate it all the more. I won a free massage after Camelback Medical Center came to my office to promote their services and offered us all free 10 minute massages. I actually went into the massage a bit grumpy because I couldn't find the place. (its next to zipps!) The staff was incredibly friendly. I honestly have never seen a medical staff so dedicated to making me feel welcome. The massage itself was very professional and the masseuse explained why certain things were hurting and helped me sort out the root of some of my tension. I do want to note (for all of the negative nancy's that will give this place a bad review), that yes... the room could have been more isolated and I did hear some of the physical therapy that was going on in the next room. The music throughout the session could have also been better. All in all, the place was so friendly, my masseuse was incredibly kind and educated, and I left feeling very happy. THAT to me, is a very good experience. Also, if you plan to visit, PLEASE don't forget that gratuity is expected. There are too many ignorant people who think that because something is \"free\", the person providing them service is taken care of.\n",

      "       I was recently referred to Camelback Medical Center after I attended a corporate massage session their marketing team held at my office. I couldn't have had a better experience. The office staff was super friendly and outgoing and they made me fell welcome right away which is nice. But the best part by far was how good my back finally feels!! I have been suffering through a bulging disc between my S1 and S2 for the past 5 years and I have probably been to 10-15 chiropractors, acupuncturists, and similar \"specialists\". Given my past experience I was very skeptical when I showed up for my appointment, but boy was I wrong. I have had 3 adjustments these past few weeks and I feel a thousand times better. My leg pain is gone and I can barely even remember what it was like before. It makes me wonder what all those other \"doctors\" were doing, beside taking my money to the bank that is. Its truly unfortunate because I was so close to resigning myself to a lifetime of pain before I came here. They even worked with me to lower my copay to almost zero because I had an out-of-network provider. I wish i could give them 1000 stars and shout their name from a mountaintop. Thank you so much Camelback Medical Center!!\n",

      "       Disliked it. I went in for two appointments to give them a try. The office is nice, and the staff is very professional and courteous. Really, the staff was my favorite part of the whole experience. The wait times are longer than I am used to. Most chiropractors in my experience don't make you wait more than 3-5 minutes, here I waited about 10 minutes for both of my visits. I did not feel like I received the attention I needed. I know my body very well, and I know where my issues are. A good indicator for me is how well chiropractors can find them and mention them to me in my first one or two visits. Other chiropractors in the area did a much better job in finding my \"bad\" spots. My neck adjustments were initiated from the head. What I mean by that is they \"whip\", or rapidly turn, the head to adjust your neck. I prefer it when adjustments are more controlled. Yes, everyone is very friendly. However, it does have a rather strong \"business\" vibe. Not that there is anything wrong with running a nice office or being successful. However, to me, it felt like I did not get enough attention or that I really mattered as a patient. Also, they offered me a 2 month care plan for X dollars and X dollars off if I signed up today. That I did not like at all. Again, nothing wrong with offering care packages, I do believe chiropractic care is a part of a healthy life, but I did not like how it was done.\n",

      "       The girls working the desk were very nice, loving, friendly women. If the doctors treated me this well I may have liked the place. Unfortunately I had the honor of meeting both of the doctors. They missed a very good calling as used car salesmen. They're caring tone of voice was plastered on with a trowel. They kept building up my problems to make them sound worse so I would feel a need to buy their $1,700 two month treatment plan. But if I buy today I'll only have to pay $1,500! Even how they read the X-ray seemed off to me \"See how the spaces between these vertebrae are smaller\". Those spaces looked the same, or even bigger to me. \"I looked over your chart VERY carefully' they both said. Ya, with what time? The 4 minutes you've had me locked in this tiny room alone? All I want is a Chiropractor who will spend more than 3 minutes at a time in the room with me. I used to be a sales man. I know that game and they were laying it on thick. If they've spent this much time perfecting their selling script, I wonder how much time they actually spent helping people. In the end, I opted for only one treatment instead of the $1,500 package. The 'Treatment' was 2 twists of my spine, very similar to the kinds my friends down at the bar give me. I guess without a $1,500 investment they just want you in and out as fast as possible. I've been going to chiropractors my entire life, I've been adjusted thousands of times, and this was the biggest crock I've seen yet.\n",

      "       I have seen a rep from CSC at two different events now in Charlotte. Most recently it was at the Charlotte 10 Miler in Balantyne. But the most memorable time was back in the summer at the 24 Hours of Booty ride in Charlotte. One of their doctors(?) was on site doing massage, stretching and perhaps mild adjustments and giving some consultation advice. I felt thoroughly pleased with the service and took a card swearing I'd be into the clinic to have a full review of my physical well being. Well being is perhaps not the best wording to use though, as I'm physically just tense and broken everywhere. I've been to a very basic chiropractor before. By basic I mean they churn you out like you're on an assembly line. Wait in a waiting room, they say \"next\", you come in, crack your neck and back and send you away in about 10 minutes or less. That's it. But that's not CSC. Here they go above and beyond \"basic chiropractor\". Before you get an adjustment you'll go through an orientation of sorts where they analyze how you're standing or sitting or whatever you're doing wrong to hurt yourself. They'll give you a list of exercises to do when you're not in the clinic getting adjusted or stretched. In the clinic they will do a light sort of massage to loosen up and stretch out your tense muscles prior to performing an adjustment on you. After a thorough adjustment you will be attached to some electrodes (I'm not sure specifically what the device is called) which vibrate your muscles to help relieve a bit of the potential pain after your adjustment. At least in my case they applied some KT tape as a \"gentle reminder\" to maintain my proper posture to prevent the pain from recurring so frequently. They're very friendly and accommodating and have an almost communal layout here for the physical therapy/chiropractic functions. I do pay quite a bit more than I did with my previous chiropractor ($65/visit here) however I'd say it's worth the improved quality of the treatment. As I loosen up more and build up the courage I may try some dry needling to see if that works too. But really, I'm just learning more about my body's \"bad habits\" and ways at this point - they do an excellent job of sharing that. By the way, this is my shout-out for Dr. Torres as she is the one I have been seeing.\n",

      "       Go here if you want a butchered excisional biopsy with bad scarring. Went to Center for Dermatology and Plastic Surgery for a mole that had been getting increasingly itchy. The doctor ended up doing an excisional biopsy. Two weeks after my stitches were removed the wound was still painful, open and oozing white. I went back to the doctor and she said oh ya it doesn't look good you'll have to come in for lasering since it's so red. That's it she didn't come up with any solution other than wanting to have me come back in the future. Granted this doctor said that I would have a quick recovery with minimal scarring. It turned out to be quite the opposite. I came back at the 1 month point and saw a different doctor as my initial doctor was not in. My wound was the same - painful, still open and oozing white. The other doctor looked at my wound and immediately realized it was infected. I had the same symptoms on the 2nd visit that I did on the 1st yet the other doctor did nothing about it. Really disappointed with the quality of work here. I am going to have a bad life long scar that won't go away with time. It's scary to think that my wound could've gotten worse if I hadn't gone back for a 2nd opinion as the 1st Dr didn't recognize the signs of infection.\n",

      "       Lackluster first impressions all around. The place is really clean and looks very high end, they also offer a lot of services you wouldn't usually have at a normal dermatologist. However I was surprised by the lack of professionalism and organization from the front desk. I came in several days earlier to fill out the initial paperwork and there was one really hard working girl who was overworked because her fellow front-deskers decided to take an extended birthday lunch. When they can back and I went to turn in my forms they were doing nail art. When I returned the day of the appointment they asked if I had filled out the initial paperwork, assuming they had lost it I asked to see my forms so I could fill out some medication I was taking. Either they lost my information or she didn't want to bother with finding my papers because she just said \"it's ok just tell the doctor when you're in there\". It instilled little confidence that my information and medical history was every even reviewed by the doctor ahead of time. The doc, Karin, spent all of maybe 10 seconds looking at my skin and made an assessment. I just felt so rushed. She did say she can't treat everything at once and you just gotta try something and see what works but I don't feel she understood how upsetting it is to have a chronic condition that interferes with your life. That I don't want to just see what works, I also understand that it takes time for your skin to change but her lack of empathy was just frustrating I wanted to cry when she left the room. I don't think my biggest concerns were really heard. If I could only work on one thing at a time then I wish she would have asked that or if I could have stressed the importance and the effect of these things. Thankfully the saving grace was her assistant who I was able to talk with a little more after about the services they offered that could help and her experiences. The whole first appt was under 10min. They recommend mostly over the counter remedies and one of the actual prescriptions that was $70 even generic and with insurance, which I couldn't even afford. They don't tell you this when they send off the prescription so I can't even get/use it right now. Underwhelmed and disappointed because I really was hopeful and anxious to get my skin taken care of the right way. We'll see if they can do anything else in 6 weeks...\n",

I waited an hour and based on the number of patients before me still in the waiting room... i expected to be another 40 to 60min delay. At the 1hr mark, the office manager announced in the waiting room, that Dr. Fredrikson was delayed with a patient, and the 3 patients had not been forgotten. Three patients plus those in the back office visiting rooms is a lot of backlog to work through. I found this to be quite disrespectful of my time and other appointments that day. I asked for a refund since I had not seen Dr. Fredrikson yet, and left. I am waiting to see how long or if the refund comes through.\n",

She took the time to carefully check my skin, including my scalp. Dr. Fredrikson's assistant, Raquel, clearly explained post mole removal care and when I could expect to get the biopsy back.

Walked me through my issues ( I have plenty) and suggested a course of action. Kristi worked with me to schedule another appointment and even told me what to expect as far as the bill.

      "       So I haven't been to the dentist in over 2 years so naturally I'm a little afraid to walk through those dental doors and meet my fate. On top of that, I am not looking forward to being lectured about how I don't floss enough or exactly how I need to brush. But, I needed a good dentist in my area so I made an appointment with Chapparal Dental. First of all, his staff is amazing. I had to reschedule my appointment a couple times and Christy was really flexible and always very nice. His office is clean, with a good selection of magazines and good music to boot. As far as the actual dental experience goes, Dr. Tricolli is the best dentist I have had. He was pleasant, funny and incredibly knowledgeable. He actually walked through my X-Rays with me and explained what was going on in my mouth. His bedside manner is excellent as well. He had suggestions as far as my oral hygiene went but never forced anything on me and didn't judge me on the fact that flossing is not necessarily an everyday activity for me. I actually walked out of his office looking forward to coming back in 6 months. That doesn't happen often I'm sure.\n",

      "       I was referred to Dr. Tricoli by our son, who had been a patient for several years. I had visited several other dentists over the last few years and been told I needed varying work (I am fifty-four,) each dentist recommending something different in a different area of my mouth. I was perplexed because, prior to our dentist passing away, he always said, \"Nice teeth CK, keep it up.\" When I mentioned this to our son, his response was, \"Dad, I have the best dentist in town.\" He was so right. Dr. Tricoli, without any prompting from me, did the normal exam and x-rays, and said, \"You have beautiful teeth and you take excellent care of them.\" No work required. In this day and age of dentists attending seminars on how to bill more, rehearse on how to \"generate concern,\" etc., this is a very refreshing experience. An honest dentist that does not look to build his revenue stream on the mouths of unsuspecting patients. His office ambiance is professional, elegantly simple and soothing. His staff is thorough, polished and are excellent communicators. When I recommend Dr. Tricoli to others, I do it with confidence. Our son was correct. The best dentist in town.\n",

      "       Just left on Easter Sunday. This place was great for the massage. But when I got done I tipped 12 dollars for my massage. The lady looked at me and said 5 more dollars! Now listen I'm new to the massage thing and I don't appreciate being told what I have to tip! This lady was really persistent too because she saw the money when I pulled it out my pocket she really told me to take the 2 singles back and give her the five I had left in my pocket! I almost flipped. Never have I been in I situation like this. I think I will come back again and not give her anything just to prove a point. I paid for my service and tipped what I had to give. The massage was great even though this is only my second one ever. But to tell the customer what they need to tip is ridiculous! Got this gift card from my wife but I will tell my wife next time put the tip in or pick another place. Great start with a terrible ending! The lost a customer over 3 funky dollars!\n",

She continued to ask me if I want oil, hot stones, etc. When I told her I only wanted a basic hour $25 massage. My actual massage started off great, towards the end she was very aggressive, left the room to continue talking to other people outside, and took my towel off my NAKED body. When I went out to pay, she sat there and talked in whatever language they speak, and I was paying with card, the receptionist showed me the tip rate and how much I have to tip. I told her yes I know already, and when I gave my massage therapist her tip, she gave me a dirty look and when I walked out I look back at her and she was just counting my tip and taking in her language again. This place has turned into 100% about money rather then their customer service and massages. I am disgusted and won't be coming back. Bitches\n",

      "       You'd think that other patrons would get that this is a massage place and would be quiet, but they don't. People chit chatting on their phones in the tiny waiting room and it seems like they are sitting right next to you. When the front desk person brings them back and puts them in the room where you are getting a massage, the patron inevitably attempts to start up a conversation with the therapist, and they both forget to whisper. The therapist will giggle and whisper to the other therapists during the session, too. Awk--ward!! And, they will leave the room multiple times during the massage to get things, or to dump and rinse out the bucket your feet were soaking in. Finally, as you go to leave and you tip the therapist, the guy behind the counter will tell you that's not enough tip and you need to tip more. The therapist, meanwhile, is standing right behind you holding the cash you just handed her and give you a look as if you just seriously insulted her and her family. Told me that \"all other customer tip better.\" They expect a *minimum* of 30% tip and will argue with you until you just walk out. Will never return.\n",

Then when I tipped her she asked for more money. So I tipped her more money and she just left and didn't say anything. The amount of money I gave her was quite a bit more than what they recommend even before I have her more. If you go I would recommend a room in the back away from the front door and make sure they aren't understaff or extremely busy were they are cutting corners. I wouldn't go here again I rather go to Massage Envy or another mom and pop place.\n",

      "       I'd give zero stars if I could. I understood from the beginning their massages were a little untraditional but I was not expecting what I was given. There's no privacy for clients, its just one room with 3 tables so you cant even undress for a proper massage. People are constantly going in and out of the room that has nothing but a shower curtain as a door, the therapists were whispering with each other the whole time when they were even in the room. For half of my appointment, I was just laying there wondering when my masseuse would come back to continue the massage. The other half of the massage, I was receiving karate chops on random parts of my body. One of my therapists just slapped a fistful of lotion on my back and then used my shirt to sop up the excess. The only good part was the foot massage although I wasn't keen on putting my feet in a bucket of water. While I was paying, I got crap from the male receptionist for not tipping enough. IMHO, I tipped much better than what was deserved. Not going to be a return customer. I'm better off giving my 5 year old son some Hot Wheels that he can run up and down my back.\n",

They kept giggling and talking to each other. The girl that I had was VERYY LAZY about the massage. There was no pressure, as if she was just touching/ rubbing my skin. I asked her to apply more pressure kindly and she starting talking away with the other workers. Out of the 60 mins I would say only half the time she was actually \"massaging\". The other half she would walk out of the room to go &amp; \"grab something, or wash her hands.

I was happy after the massage then walked up to the front to pay, not only the guy charged my 90 min / $45 wrong, I was forced to pay the tip between $12-17 dollars. He charged my card $46, I don't know if it was by mistake or not, but to be forced to pay 30% tip was not a pleasant feeling after my massage. I will not recommend this place. Tip amount should be up to the customer based on the quality of the service (10-15% is reasonable) not a mandatory 30% + percentage by the store.\n",

I walked in today and was on the phone. I told the person I had to go because I didn't want to disturb the other people. Coco said \"it's okay there's no one here\". She asked how long did I want. Then before I could answer she said do you have an appointment? I told her no. She said \"oh we're busy, sorry, do you want to make and appointment?\" I told her \"no, I don't live around her and I won't come back here ever again!\" I am so pissed. What kind of company turns away customers. If you are so busy then at least put a sign up saying you are accepting appointments only instead of having customers think you accept walk ins.

First, is about the medical doctor who treated me with my back pain. She is very caring and concerned, friendly while maintaining professionalism. She listened to all my concerns and got my problems resolved even without an appointment.. Thank you so much DR. ADA EGBUJI, for providing me an outstanding treatment and care. Secondly, is about the physical therapist who provided me with excellent help &amp; support. He is extremely positive &amp; encouraging. He is very helpful &amp; knowledgeable in answering all my concerns and addressed them. He provided me with excellent information, care and treatment.. i considered my first PT appointment exceptional. Thank you so much MR Christopher W. KOKKINIS, your help &amp; care are greatly appreciated. Thirdly, i want to say \"thank you\" to all the Staff, you made my first visit a very pleasant one.. Special mention to Marco for being very helpful, respectful &amp; attentive.\n",

Still horrible long wait times. Got here 30 minutes before my scheduled appointment and got called in ten minutes after the time. Did the drug test, height/weight, eye exam, color exam done in 15 minutes. Then waited for the physical portion with a doctor... waiting going on to close to 45 minutes for the doctor as I write this review. Physical exam done in 5 minutes. So a 20 minute physical and drug screen takes approx almost two hours in and out here. I added time to because of waiting for your paperwork at the end. Two stars because everyone is so friendly and the location is clean - they even offer coffee and water while you wait. The wait isn't so bad as compared to other Concentra locations, but seriously the wait.\n",

A total of 15 minutes patient care. 5 mins to take my vitals, height and weight. 5 mins to take my pee for drug screen. 5 mins for physical. Waited outside lobby again to wait for paper work. Total visit time of 3.5 hours for pre employment physical and drug screening.

      "       3.5 stars I had seen this place driving by but found out it was an in network benefit when I checked my insurance website. I'd been sick for 4 days and was in denial that it was anything more than an upper respiratory infection, or a cold. I finally decided to head in knowing my symptoms weren't ER worthy, but realizing that my primary care wouldn't be able to swab for the flu. When I walked in I noticed a very strong scent. Being sick, it was actually a little unbearable. I wasn't sure if it was a strong cleaning product or a room deodorizer but I was really bothered by it! When I checked in at the front desk I asked the woman if they swabbed for the flu. She said yes but that I'd probably be there for hours. I wasn't sure if she was just informing me of the long wait, or discouraging me from waiting, but I proceeded to sign in. The good: I was only there a couple of hours in total, which was better than I though with how badly they were playing up the wait time. The place was clean. Plenty of seats in the waiting room. The bad: One of the techs or medical assistants didn't introduce themselves when they came in to do a test on me. When I received my discharge papers no one went over the prescription (side effects, how and when to take, etc.). I'm not sure if this was because they knew I was in the healthcare field or not, but either way I would never hand my patients a prescription and then say, \"you're free to go.\" It's never fun to have to go to Urgent Care but if you really need to, this isn't a bad place to go. It's better than waiting 8 hours and clogging up a busy ER with flu-like complaints, and it's probably more beneficial to you than waiting a few days to see your doctor. I'd go again if needed.\n",

There is a girl named Lathasha that was just 100 percent on it she was so friendly and very helpful. She remebered my name everytime I went in there. She helped me with my workmans comp insurance and everything. They offered bottled water, snacks and candy as well. When I went back to see the Doctors there are two of them and they are great although I favor the older gentlemen both doctors sit down and talk to you.

We also had a massage which calmed us a bit. All of the other guests we interacted with were very friendly and made us feel welcome.

      "       This is the best couples massage experience! Fully nude out in the Vegas sun! Relaxing in a zen garden of beautiful scenery and lovely music. It's such a liberating experience. Perfect for first timers or veteran nudists. We had lunch snacks and drinks ok our naked spa day. Theres multiple pools and a dancing/club area. The people are classy and we're great company. Great conversation! Good times! Then our massage! The therapist were excellent! One of the best massages Ive ever had. We both enjoyed the relaxing experience.For dinner we went just around the corner to the strip. It was the best of both worlds. This was a clean up kept facility with friendly attentive staff. Very professional. We'll definitely be back!\n",

      "       This place is all about the Sea Mountain One Love female centric inspiration. It's at the best nude resort with the best nude pool and best topless pool in Vegas. I felt so safe and welcomed, I always prefer a female masseuse and here it was no big deal. The couples massage was amazing for us both it's practically mind altering! The Sea Mountain massage day package with lunch and full private retreat was the ultimate spa-cation. If your looking to just zen out and relax or looking for the best swingers party in town it's the ultimate place to go! Something for everybody especially my fellow nude and topless loving females and couples. Staff service is exceptional but main reason we came was the absolutely perfect couples massage in the private villas at the retreat!\n",

      "       The spacious office is easy to get to via the 202. The staff is friendly and compentent. The dental hygienist does an excellent job cleaning your teeth. The two dentists working there are brothers. The problem is one of the brother is very good while the other brother isn't very good. I got a new crown recently. I knew something was wrong when my mouth was still numb after 12 hours. Usually the numbness wears off after 2-4 hours. I was in pain with the crown. They finally recommended I go get a root canal. The endodontist said I didn't need a root canal. He spent about 15-30 seconds grinding off a high point on the crown. There was also a cut in the gums by the crown that was causing pain. I'm very disappointed that my dentist couldn't fix his own problem and recommended me to get a root canal when the problem was his own doing.\n",

      "       This review will be an overall experience I have had at this office for the past year. Mind you, I have never, EVER, had a positive time at a dentist. I will try to break this down into different categories so you may understand the different levels of care these professionals use. Receptionist- This is where your first impression is made, and they sure know how to take care of patients. I first came into this office with a cracked tooth, as they were closing. Robin took the lead in my care, ensuring I would be seen within 24 hours. She made sure my insurance would cover me, and make sure I was happy before leaving with my appointment. They are fully informed with insurance needs, and go over everything necessary so you don't get blind sided with charges. Techs- The ladies that I have worked with are Summer, and Heather. Both of these ladies took the time to get to know me, and my anxiety issues with the dentist. They ensure I'm comfortable, and take precautions as needed if I ever have a problem. They make you feel like family in that office, and I always enjoy coming back. They ensure the job is done, and make sure you get the best care you can. Docs- Doctor Randy and Travis Cullimore are strictly professionals. They both make you feel engaged in your treatment plan. I have had Dr. Randy more, and he really makes me feel comfortable. During any operation, he explains what will be happening and why. Overall- Sorry for the long review, but this place deserves the best! If you need to find a dentist that will work with you regardless of insurance, leave you smiling, and make you feel like a family... not a customer, this is the place for you. I will continue returning to this office, and I'm so glad I chose the Cullimore Family Dentistry.\n",

Within 3 months one of the cavities worked on has already come back then I call to make an appointment and the refuse to meet my schedule to help relieve my pain in a timely fashion! There is no doctor on weds and like an average business the doctors refuse to stay late on a Friday to help me (by late I mean til 2pm)!!! I'm a full time student with a full time job extremely disappointing knowing they will not meet me in the middle to accommodate especially after spending (to me) a lot of money!

Staff were friendly and professional. Got some xrays, then saw the dentist. Everything was handled in a profesional manner. No complaints. They were not disrespectful or pushy. All in all a good first experience. I learned my dental discomfort is likely a sinus infection. Update: One year later they started telemarketing me. For that they lose a star.

A coworker had told me of something called the \"liquid nose job.\" So at my last appointment, I asked Dr Price about it. I had developed a divot on the upper bridge of my nose, where it had thinned out. Dr Price was able to expertly apply a small amount of filler to that area, to give me a sleeker, smoother profile. Needless to say, when I attended my 20th college reunion last month, I received so many compliments! I am so thrilled with the results, and so happy with my skin :)\n",

Dr. Price was able to fit me in relatively quickly and I am so thankful that I took the time to see her! She was very compassionate and genuinely showed personal interest in my skin problems. She was able to help me combat my acne and expertly injected botox, to give a smooth, natural look. I am extremely happy with the way that my skin looks now, and I would highly recommend Dr. Price.\n",

To start, Cashmere answered the phone and was extremely professional and did a great job speaking to the dr's and level of service offered. She was kind enough to get me in the same day after listening to my concerns. When I arrived I was greeted by Cashmere after a short wait I was taken back to the patient room with Summer. Summer listened to all of my concerns and was wonderful. I did not feel rushed and felt as though she was listening to my every word. Summer was typing all of my concerns into the system but continued to make eye contact the entire time. I really appreciated this. Shortly there after I met Dr. Price and Shiela. Dr. Price was fantastic. She is a very kind, knowledgable and lovely person and Dr. I am so thrilled to have found her. In the end Shiela was thorough in ensuring that she covered all that Dr. Price wanted to discuss as well treatments for all areas. I had my prescriptions called in before I walked out the door with a lovely lady in the front. The overall experience was wonderful. This office is top notch and I look forward to going there for many years to come.\n",

      "       Probably one of the best experiences I have had with a doctor's office in Las Vegas. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient. The wait was minimal. The medical assistant that helped us was awesome, he sat down with us to get my daughters history and took the time to listen to our reasons for the visit. The auditory specialist that checked my daughter's hearing was fantastic, she was personable and made my daughter feel at ease.. Dr. Foggia was great too, I feel like he was really helpful and will really try to get to the root of the issues that my daughter is having. My teenage daughter even commented how nice every single person was that we interacted with.\n",

      "       We were referred to Dr. Foggia by my daughters pediatrician. I've dragged my feet to go and we finally went and I had no problems with the office staff, the PA's or the DR himself. She does need her tonsils and adenoids removed. He explained it in layman's terms to my 5 year old and I. The surgery scheduler was nice. We scheduled the surgery the day of our appointment for December and received all the paperwork needed. My 5 year old is nervous and I'm optimistic and nervous but overall he was great and the staff was normal medical staff. Not bad not spectacular. But there was no attitude or issues. UPDATE Her surgery went VERY well, I would recommend him to anyone. The surgery center &amp; their staff was amazing as well. They told me everything I needed for followup instructions and everything I could expect and they were right to a tee. Thank you Dr. Foggia\n",

      "       Quite possibly the worse service I've ever experienced. They only get away with it because they are one of the few games in town that does pre-approval for hearing aids under HPN. Every three years I am forced to endure their services again so they can confirm I am still deaf, and then insurance will cover hearing aids. You have to call the \"appointment dept\" and leave a message, and they will call you back when they feel like it, if ever. Then they told me one time over the phone and another time when the automated service called to confirm. It takes a long time to get in, and then I had to reschedule. I'm sure the staff is permitted to treat their patients this way because Dr. Foggia's bedside manner is just as bad. I came in for difficulty hearing at age 40, thought it was due to allergies. He walked in and told me I had the hearing of an 80 year old and I needed hearing aids, gave me a referral for aids, and then abruptly walked out. I was stunned because I was not expecting that, and actually sat there crying in disbelief. I dread going back there every year!\n",

      "       WOW!!! Is all I can say!!! All of us know that finding a great Dr is hard to do in our valley. When I was recommended to see Dr. Foggia by my PCP, I was very leary due to reviews here on Yelp, but I took into account that this is someone my PCP said they would send their family members to. I took a chance and made myself an appointment. To make an appointment it was very easy, the woman who answered the call was extremely friendly and very accommodating to my tight schedule, and she also turned me on to their website where I was able to print the new patient paperwork to save me time, but I was also able to read and learn about the Dr. I was about to see. This put ease to my mind. When I arrive for my appointment in March I was greeted by very friendly smiling faces at the front desk, they inquired about my paperwork, which I was able to hand right over completed. It took a few minutes for them to put together my chart and I was informed they would be calling me back shortly. The wait was not too long, though I am willing to wait for excellent care! I was taken into the exam area, I am a nosy thing who had to check everything out, including cleanliness, as well as how the employees interact. I was extremely happy with what I saw and was completely confident that my PCP sent me to the right office. Dr. Foggia came into the room shortly after I was brought back into the room. He was extremely knowledgeable and also took the time to explain everything to me in terms I was able to understand and bring home a full knowledge of my condition. He recommended a hearing test which would allow him to see if there was a problem within the inner ear, the test was preformed right there in the office!! After the test I was given the results by Dr. Foggia himself who informed me I had fluid behind my ear drum and was given an antibiotic and I would need to follow up to make sure has resolved, and also explained the procedure I may need if it does not. I happily scheduled the return appointment with the woman at check out. I am happy to report that my hearing has returned to normal. I would recommend Dr. Foggia to ALL of my friends and family, I have even schedule an appointment to bring my child in with me on the same day as my own follow up appointment!\n",

      "       I'm so very disappointed with this office, I really wish I could give negative stars for this place. Let me start by saying I work in a doctors office and was appalled because I would never treat a patient the way my son and I were treated here. My two year old son was referred to this place from an old friend of min that Dr. Foggia has worked on for years, so I naturally expected an excellent practice with excellent service. We arrived 8 minutes late to our new patient appointment, just due to trying to find the place, and upon check in was promptly told that we would have to be \"worked back into the schedule since we were 10 minutes late\". The front desk girl asked me what my copay was for a specialist office, and when I told her I wasn't sure, she pulled a number out of a hat and said that $50 would be my copay and they would bill me for a balance or send me a check for a credit. I was SHOCKED that she just chose a number and didn't even bother to calculate the copay or call the insurance. I called my insurance and they told me that with my HSA account I would very likely have no copay but the front desk demanded it anyway!!! I paid my son's copay and we waited for OVER AN HOUR to be seen. Once in the back a guy nurse came to the room and asked the usual questions then used a small tool to \"take a picture\" of my sons ears. What was it? Hell if I know. First time at an ENT office so I hardly knew what to expect for my two year old. I thought the tool was part of the nurses workup for my son to be seen by the doctor. Then, enters Dr. Foggia... I will say he is efficient but hardly personable. He seemed to know what he was talking about and addressed some major points, despite the fact that his demeanor and bedside manner was comparable to Ben Stein. Upon checking out, this sloppy girl with a tongue ring was impatient with the male nurse getting my chart. Saying things like, \"If so and so would give me your chart I could finally get you checked out.\" After getting the chart she tells me that there's an ADDITIONAL $25 COPAY for the tool used by the male nurse on my son!!! She claimed that anything done in the back office was subject to a charge and that was indicated in the paperwork I signed. I told her that even so, no verbal communication ensued in the back to indicate that the \"picture\" of my sons ear was optional. No verbal indication of it's purpose or necessity was provided AT ALL. I told her that I worked in a professional office and we ALWAYS indicate what is being done to the patient before they consent to treatment. She shrugged and said \"it's our office policy\", with her tongue ring gleaming in the fluorescence. So I guess it's safe to assume when going here you may be charged a glove fee, chair cleaning fee, gauze fee, pen sterilization fee, weight taking fee, temperature acquisition fee, etc, etc. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place unless you like migraines between 8am and 5 pm during any given day.\n",

      "       I've never been to a dentist that doesn't try to do more than necessary until Dr Green. I don't feel taken advantage of, they are very honest and only do what's necessary to get your teeth to where they need to be. I had 3 fillings that have fallen out/chipped because I grind my teeth, and they did their due diligence to see if they needed to drill and redo the filling but they decided it wasn't necessary and only a sealing needed to be done. So they saved me a ton of money, time and pain by being so very honest and upfront. I'm so happy I've stumbled upon them and I just tell everyone about how reasonably priced they are and how honest and caring they are. If you need a dentist, call and make an appt ASAP bc these guys are the BEST!\n",

In the 7 years since my original review, I have chosen to continue to see Dr. Green for my dental needs even though my dental insurance has changed and she is no longer covered. She's that good. I am never pressured to get unnecessary services by Dr. Green. The care she has for her patients well being is obviously genuine. And it's not just Dr Green. Her entire staff is excellent. From walking in and being greeted by Lisa the office manager... to getting a cleaning by Bassima, the most gentle dental hygenist ever.. I was in this week for a cleaning. I walked out with a smile just 33 minutes later. I've waited 33 minutes past my appointment time at other dentists without being seen! They appreciate how precious people's time is at Dr Greens office. If you told me a decade ago that going to the dentist could be enjoyable, I would have laughed in your face. That was before.

I have the utmost respect for Dr.Green, Lisa and the dental hygienist staff and their ability to protect my oral health. Besides the great dental work, it's always a very pleasant visit.\n",

      "       I simply adore this place. And yes, I just said that about a dentist. Referred by the lovely Jessie B, knowing I was scared to death, she pretty much insisted I try her place. My first visit was 2015, for an urgent tooth pulling when in pain. I was so nervous, and in and out within 30 minutes. I couldn't believe how fast, gentle, and professional everyone was. My family and I have not gone anywhere since. From cleanings to major work, this is where I prefer to take my business. I have gone here with my insurance, as well as cash pay, and felt valued no matter what. From the desk to the techs to the Dr, I really enjoy entire staff. Dreading the dentist is now a thing of the past for me, thanks to Dr. Green.\n",

      "       Nobody I know likes going to the dentist, most of all me but today I took that first step and went to go see Dr. Green after 25yrs of being dentist free. After so many years of not taking care of my teeth one becomes embarrassed at the thought of opening your mouth to a stranger. Not the whitest teeth, caps missing, cavities and bonding that's over 20yrs old.. the thought horrified me. I'm pleased to say I found my dentist. Dr Green is absolutely fabulous! The minute I talked to Lisa at the front desk I was put to ease, the second I had my teeth X-ray'ed by the technician my doubts were gone and the instant I met Dr Green I knew I found my dentist. Gentle, to the point, direct, funny and an outstanding staff. Today was a good day Is it weird that I'm looking forward to going back and getting started on my mess of a mouth??\n",

      "       Since moving to Las Vegas I haven't found a dentist that I really liked. My insurance covers a dentist that is right around the corner from my house but after doing more research online, I then found Dr. Green on Zocdoc. And boy I am so glad I did! The drive to her office is well worth it for me. I was really DREADING coming to the dentist because I hadn't been in awhile and I desperately needed a cleaning and to fill some cavities. I was so nervous and walked into her office shaking, but her staff made me feel very comfortable and they put my mind at ease. They are very professional and I was definitely satisfied with my overall experience. My two cavities didn't take very long at all. Maybe 20 minutes and I was on my way out. Friendly, professional staff and comfortable office. Can't wait to make my next appointment now!\n",

A different Dentist told me I could NOT sit in the room with them. I called her office, they got me in same day and allowed me to sit with my children. Through the years she has never overcharged us -and always had my kids best interest at heart! My son who is now 23 and lives in Reno, called her to make an appointment and is flying in specifically to see her. He went to a Dentist in Reno, and realized he needed someone he could trust.

      "       Dr. Dawn Green and her staff are amazing. I can't believe it took me 7 years to write this review.... As the previous reviewer mentions, dentist visits were never my favorite, but coming to Dr. Greens office is one of my favorite medical visits to attend... Her stuff hasn't changed since the first time I came to her office, they have amazing attitudes and are always doing everything to accommodate their patients. Talking here about Roxane and Lisa of course. Atmosphere in here is always so relax and laid back that it really doesn't feel like you are in a dentist office. Between jokes and chats they are cleaning and fixing your teeth, and by the time they are done u kinda don't wanna leave...thinking that you have to wait another 6months to see them. And finally about Dr. Green herself... Well in a the world of businesses that everyone is ruled by money Dr Green is definitely not one of them. She always puts her patients comfort and well being first. She provides and performs the highest level of services expected. And as a matter of fact other dentists, that I had to go to, were impress with the dental work she did on some of my teeth. Thank you so much to the whole stuff for taking such a great care of my teeth through these years!\n",

      "       2 years ago I was in Vegas on a business trip and had a dental emergency. I was referred to Dr. Dawn Green from the hotel Concierge (I also found her through Google and saw good reviews on her) so I went to her office. NOT SOMETHING ONE EVER WANTS TO DO, BUT THERE IT WAS! I went and have such a good-news story to share with everyone as a result of this unexpected visit -- and since I was just in town last week and saw her again, I thought it's finally time to share my experience with everyone! Dr. Green's staff were so friendly - it was a small family-type office feeling. They got me in-and-out so quick and efficient, and with honest and reasonable prices. The office was very clean and comfortable. I NEVER enjoyed going to the dentist, but this experience was far from my normal dread experiences of the past - in a great way! Dr. Green even told me that the FOUR (4) CAVITIES my regular dentist told me I had (and had been waiting to get filled when I had more $$) actually didn't exist! I always thought my dentist (Dr. Garcia DDS in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida - watch out for him everyone!!) was ripping me off and Dr. Green confirmed it! My teeth are in great shape and I only had the broken tooth to fix - no cavities!!!! Because of this experience, I've actually made my dentist appointments with Dr. Green now over the past 2 years, and I schedule them around my regular business trips to Vegas. I always wanted to share this story with others because I truly believe Dr. Dawn Green is the best and most honest dentist out there! I just wish she lived and practiced in Florida so I don't have to fly to Vegas for my dental appointments! SO -- if you are in need of a GREAT dentist whose office won't be torture or a rip-off charade -- you're in luck if you live in Vegas!\n",

      "       From 2/9/16 Came to the Denovo Clinic to get myself healthy, get a colonic, and drop some LB's. The Denovo a is located in Village Square, on the second of the professional offices building. First, let me just say the staff is phenomenal, everyone there is super friendly, and professional. Also, they are knowledgeable; you feel like you're in good hands because they educate you on the service you are choosing. Now the colonic, it is about a forty-minute process, you get dressed in the gown, and then you proceed to be cleansed. It is mixture feeling relaxed and slightly uncomfortable as the process goes along because when they hit a blockage, you will feel some pressure, not pain, but kind of like having gas. The process is fascinating to watch as well; you really get an understanding of what is in your body from doing a colonic. After you are done, don't be surprised if you have a little bloating, and feel a bit dehydrated so drink a ton of water after your colonic. I have a bunch more to go since I bought a package of 5 which 260 for 4, get one free. I will be using these guys for a bunch of other services, very impressed.\n",

      "       Here you will find the integrative, holistic, homeopathic, nutrition based, natural approach combined with careful state of the art technology for testing and the extraordinary skill set of Dr. Carol Ann Chaney,.. She is so impressive, I don't even have the words to describe it. She trained with some of the most brilliant Doctors in the country &amp; her training, experience &amp; ability to problem solve is superb. She is extremely careful in her assessments. She dots her i's &amp; crosses her t's and gives you answers to questions you most likely have not even considered. Her follow-thru is excellent. My health improvements with her recommendations was sensational. Based on clinical testing, by a Holistic MD in the valley who is also sensational, Dr. Carol Ann Chaney made incredible headway in one week. Check my other reviews for excellent holistic doctors and practitioners in Las Vegas &amp; beyond. As a bonus, Dr. Chaney has a lovely, genuine and caring style which is obvious from the moment you start your first consultation. That is a nice plus, but honestly what matters to me after working closely with doctors and scientists for the past 12 plus years... The important part is not a doctors personality. So many times people decide a doctor is great because they are nice or charming. Really a precision driven doctor who is brilliant, with Great clinical and intuitive skills is what I respect, admire and seek in a practitioner. A doctor who is secure and not threatened by well informed patients, who want to understand fully what is happening &amp; want to understand the root cause as opposed to just treating the symptoms with RX scripts for drugs &amp; more RX scripts... A doctor who thinks and researches, serves their patient and concerns themselves with their patients whole body health, not the insurance companies' directives or the drug companies powerful influence. It truly is The Road Less Traveled these days. You may not be able to get an appointment as her available time is limited &amp; she is in high demand. If she can't fit you in, I would recommend you get on her wait list &amp; even if it takes a year to get an appointment, you will benefit greatly. She is brilliant and you will be blown away by her knowledge and ability to co-create health with you. It takes a team effort to achieve your best results! Being personally trained and mentored along with my husband by renowned holistic dentist, immunologist &amp; scientist, Dr. Hal Huggins, I can say with confidence, Dr. Carol Ann Chaney Is the real deal.\n",

He held a pep talk with me and especially my daughter. He spent time in explaining about the program specifically for my daughter as she was new to it. I should say she left the office feeling inspired and ready to get started. Close to 50 days later, she's still goin'! I'd like to also commend the other staff members for their time and support. I truly owe De Novo Clinic the confidence I have gained back; and now, my daughter's also on her way to feeling and looking great! Thank you so much and please continue to do good to your patients.\n",

      "       I have been doing keto for over 6 months and having a stall. My husband recommended a doctors review of my current situation. My husband researched keto doctors in Arizona (on the Jimmy Moore site) &amp; suggested I make an appointment. I called and spoke to F/O staff completely explaining the reason I wanted to come in to see the doctor. I was told Dr Derosa did not see patients anymore, but trained each health care provider on her way of medicine. I had an appointment booked almost a month out. I did not request any specific person due to the fact I left it up to the F/O scheduler to put me with someone who could address my keto concerns. I checked into the front desk 15 mins early and gave them my name &amp; was told to sit down until my appointment. Less than 2 minutes to my appointment time I was asked \"why I was there?\"... Then I instructed to fill out over 10 pages of paperwork due to the fact the person who scheduled me did not write why I was coming in to see the doctor. I was brought back before finishing the paperwork and met with Kylie Kersten FNP. She was friendly, concerned and listen to my story. Asked a few questions and ran blood work. Did not mention or ask one keto related question. Neither negative or positive about this way of life. I left feeling defeated and like I wasted my time. I explained to my husband who took the time to research keto doctors in Arizona and he was frustrated that Dr Derosa advertised as a keto specialist. After my blood draw I was told to return in one week for follow up. The F/O staff did not have an opening for over three weeks. I now have to wait 3 weeks to review my blood work. Feeling frustrated again. Not impressed with this office for my specific concerns. This is not a Keto/low carb option.\n",

      "       Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. I tried out DeRosa after needing to leave my current doctors office and was hopeful as they utilize natural hormone therapy. The nurse practitioner I saw made a bunch of assumptions about me (like so many doctors do) and hardly asked questions. When I shared my history with her I felt like she was barely listing. At my follow-up visit after blood work we basically had the same conversation like she didn't remember talking to me at all. The best part was the bill I got after that was DOUBLE what I usually pay for my copay. When I called to talk to billing they basically said there was nothing they could do since they already billed my insurance and they would have someone call me back.....which they didn't big surprise! Maybe if I had a wonderful experience it would have been worth the money.....but I will not be going back there and hope no one else goes through this with a doctor there.\n",

      "       I need to speak to Mary Montes. I have had a problem with getting a couple prescriptions filled because my insurance changed to Mercy Care after I was laid off the end of June. They don't take Mercy Care but they were very happy to try &amp; help get it filled. This was over 2 months ago &amp; talked to many people along the way but nobody is communicating with anyone else, including me. Then today I hear back that they now won't even see me for my pellets, which are out of pocket anyway &amp; I've always paid. I had been laid off for a year, 2 yrs back &amp; paid for pellets out of pocket, as well as the office calls. But since I told one of the girls I was having problems with people communicating with me, she called the next day &amp; told me I can no longer come in for my pellets. She also implied that Mercy Care was for poor people &amp; I shouldn't be on it. She has no clue of my situation or the insurance system, apparently. I left a message for Mary to call me but I doubt she will receive it. I have been very happy with Mary Montes &amp; feel the pellets have helped me, but now I can't even talk to her. My name is Joy Alberico.\n",

I have lived with a physician for 20+ years, so I have some reliable sources as to what is unacceptable medical protocol. They rarely return calls and even when they do they continue making the same mistakes. They ignore my requests to have my medications refilled, they fill some and then there are others that they just do not do until I call and call and call. Once I had to drive the 20 miles to get my refill written up correctly. They just keep calling in the incorrect dosages and quantity. THEY DO NOT CARE! They write my prescriptions incorrectly every month, no matter how many times I point it out to them. I will be getting a new PCP.\n",

      "       I tried DeRosa Medical for the pellets a few months ago. The insertion was a little rough and hit a nerve or two. I didn't experience this with SottoPelle. My BIG complaint is the charges. This company does not ever really tell/explain what the possible costs could be up front. What the total cost is if you pay cash and what the total charge would be if using insurance. I have insurance so I went the route of using insurance not knowing the possible outcome. I just received a bill from DeRosa and it shows my insurance paid approx. $1200.00 and the remainder balance of $2200 and change is due from me. There is NO way I would have had this procedure done if I would have been told upfront the total cost was $3500. Come on, Really, and they want you to come back about every 3-4 months to do it again, meaning about $10k to $15k per year.\n",

I had to reiterate everything we had done. All she suggested was more blood work in 3 months. That's all they do here, is take blood, and see you for 2 minutes and tell you to have more blood work in another 3 months. I assumed the three prior times blood work was done would be sufficient. They repeat the same blood work every 3 months. And never suggest repair and address the issues. Only go here if you want people to be rude and dis-interested in you. Hell, all you are is a co-pay.

We learned that high testosterone can cause heart problems and prostrate cancer!!!! Dr. DeRosa targeted testosterone level at 1200, but according to my husband's primary doctor and other sources, it should NOT be that high!!!! Our doctor seemed shocked and horrified that another doctor had taken my husband's testosterone level so high!!! According to an internet source: \"...Moreover, some researchers suggest that the healthiest men have testosterone levels between 400 - 600 ng/dL.\" There is another reviewer, Jane L., whose husband also experienced the same overdose of testosterone!! If you love and appreciate your husband, keep him away from this office!!! If you don't like your husband, be sure to make an appointment and keep sending him back!!! You may find yourself a widow in due time. It was SHOCKING to see the insurance printout cost for the simple procedure: The procedure takes minutes wherein a small \"the size of a rice grain\" implant is placed just under the skin. It is over in no time. The cost is approximately $2,000 ??????? WHAT???? It is not major surgery!!!! Thank God our insurance company was stupid enough to pay for it, or else we have had to pay out of pocket!! The office will REQUIRE and persuade you to sign off that it is your responsibility to pay for the procedure, as you really won't know if the insurance will pay until they receive the bill!! I feel this is a scam to make a lot of money off of desperate people!! I also am disturbed that insurance companies are paying out such extreme amounts of money!!! No wonder our insurance premiums are skyrocketing and so are our deductibles!!!!\n",

I let her know one of my medications was no longer working so she gave me a new med to try out and if it didn't work to call her in a week. I've left 4 voicemail's in the last week to tell her my meds are still not working and I have gotten haven't gotten a response. Thank god I have some old backups of an older med that was working which I asked her to switch me back to and she didn't want too. I've called for Dr Iacovelli numerous times in the past and she gets back to me within hours, even when she is out of the office. I honestly don't know who dropped the ball here but i just blame the whole back office staff, or specifically her assistant and her. Switching to Dr Lasale was the worst decision I could have made, i should have waited to be seen by Dr Iacovelli. I let the front office know what happened and they said they'd call me back and of course they didn't,and i called a left more messages. I'm switching to a different practice who cares about their patients as DeRosa obviously don't care, stay away!\n",

      "       EDIT: I'm amending this because I was emotional when I wrote it and I didn't have all the information. I'm still rating them 1 star because I still feel like this office did me a great disservice but I wanted to actually outline why. So I was contacted by them to resolve a $50 no show fee which I'm contesting because I cancelled my appointment through their text service. Creepily they figured out who I was and actually called me as well as sending me a message on here. It reminded me that nothing is anonymous online. The person who responded to me said that they would work with their billing department and send me a revised statement. I haven't received anything as of today but will update here when I receive it. As for what happened, here's the update in brief (sort of): I went there because a friend recommended them. The first NP I met with was very nice but I quickly noticed some issues around the second appointment. First of all, she ran a complete battery of tests on me and when I returned for follow-up she told me I had hypothyroidism and low vitamin D. She didn't address the vitamin D deficiency despite this being a huge issue. (I didn't know that at the time but I've done some subsequent research.) I was prescribed Armour Thyroid for my thyroid and Metformin and birth control for my PCOS. The doctor also came in and diagnosed me with hypothyroidism without even running tests. So by the time my blood was taken I was already on the Armour Thyroid. That seems kind of odd right? I returned a few months later and this NP was gone. I was scheduled with another one who I instantly liked. She was very nice and personable but again, no mention of the vitamin D and in fact, it seemed like she had never even looked at my file. I had to tell her all the things that we were doing already. She adjusted my meds because I was feeling awful. I also asked her at that time if there was any reason why the meds would be causing me to sweat uncontrollably on my head. I was getting married in a couple months and was concerned that I would look terrible in the pictures as well as just being concerned about it. She said that she didn't know what would cause it but that she would \"ask around\" and she suggested botox. I can't afford botox (it's not covered by insurance) and really that sounded like a bad idea anyway so I said no thanks. She didn't check into the head sweating or if she did, she never brought it up again. I was so overwhelmed with wedding planning and not feeling great that I just let it go. I went off birth control right before the wedding because it was making me irritable just like before.This seemed to improve my mood a bit but the weight gain continued. I returned the month after my wedding because I felt so awful I could barely function. My blood sugar and blood pressure was dropping suddenly with no correlation to anything I ate or drank. I was so dizzy sometimes that I couldn't stand up. I missed work because I couldn't drive. I was exhausted, like barely dragging myself around. And I was gaining weight fast. I had actually been slowly gaining weight (despite my thyroid levels being normal, a moderately healthy diet, exercise and Metformin) for over a year. I still don't know why this is happening because the weight gain has only slowed but if my levels were truly being managed I would have been losing weight. The NP adjusted my meds again and told me to \"be careful and lie down if I felt dizzy\" and sent me on my way with an order for more tests. I did the test and had it sent back to their office and my follow up was scheduled for a month out. But who wants to feel awful for a month?! I tried to move it up and was scheduled with someone else but I had pretty much had it at that point. I stopped taking the Armour Thyroid first and felt almost instantly better. I made an appointment with an endocrinologist who put me on Synthroid and I felt even better although still tired and still gaining weight. I also stopped taking the Metformin and my blood sugar normalized. It hadn't regulated my cycles over the course of a year so it was silly to keep taking it. I canceled my appt with them right after that. So after all that I had a kidney stone that was making me feel bad and it turns out that head sweating is a COMMON symptom of vitamin d deficiency. How they missed all of that, I don't know. I can't believe that I wasted a year of my life feeling awful and putting my trust in their hands. I'm ashamed of myself for not being more aware and I'm angry that this medical practice took so much of mine and my insurance's money. Would not ever recommend.\n",

Each week I have either lost a pound and/or lost body fat. One week I felt terrible that I had lost a single pound, however I had gone down 5% body fat. The staff is quite supportive--Hind, Nancy and Amber are always there to cheer me on! In short, if you are debating on trying MiraVita- I highly recommend it. I feel great- and have never felt jittery or even alone in this battle of weight loss. I am closing in on the final pounds of my weight loss and am excited on the approaching next steps of maintaining.\n",

      "       After putting up with this office for over a year, My husband and I are DONE! The last 4-6 times we went to have labs drawn, the Lab would not be able to find our orders as DeRosa medical once again did not send them. The Lab commented that this happens alot from DeRosa Medical. We would have to leave, wait for the office to open, attempt to call and after 3-6 times of being sent to voicemail someone would finally answer the phone. When someone did answer from one of her many offices, I would attempt to get her to transfer me to the office that I am seen in, but I would either get disconnected, or of course the voicemail. If you leave a voicemail it takes 4-6 hours before they get back to you. Every pellet insertion my husband received, he encountered a new nurse or usually one in training until he insisted upon someone with experience that knew what they were doing! He would tell them the pain he experienced the last time and they would say, \"Oh thats normal with the amount of pellets you are receiving.\" In one of his many visits with different PA's the male PA said,\"You aren't taking enough Testoterone, all men should be at 1200.\" NOW his hematocrit/hemoglobin is so high from excessive testosterone that he has had to have 3 Therapeutic Phlebotamies (Blood draw of 500 ml) and he is still struggling to get his H/H levels down. They were not real confident in handling this situation! I went online to find out about High Testosterone (polycythemia) while I thought this office would have been more informed. He is only in his 40's and is at very high risk for thrombosis and stroke! This is so dangerous! They gave him very little information! I had an appointment in March for some ear problems. The nurse came in, took vitals and said the PA (David Sorenson) would be in shortly. In comes a Medical Student and she starts to exam me then upon leaving the room states that PA would be in to see me. After waiting a while, the nurse comes in and says,\"You're all ready to go, we have your RX.\" I said, \" for what?, I haven't even seen the PA!\", she said, \"it's for acid reflux.\" Ear issues are now acid reflux?? You are kidding me!!! I walked out of the office after 1 1/2 hours! Two months later, I get a bill for seeing this PA. I called to let them know, I was not going to pay for a visit when I didn't even see the PA!! I then reported it to my Insurance for Fraud! Just recently, I did the usual call of 4-6 times to confirm my husband's appointment and when we got to the office, they said, \"You don't have an appt.\" Linda, the office manager came out from behind the petition and said, \"Well, we have alot of new girls training on the phones today.\" So that is our fault. In the same office altercation, my husband asked for his H/H levels after his 1st phlebotomy, since they weren't going to see him for an appt. he had scheduled, and he was told by the front desk girls they couldn't give him that information!! What?!! Upon leaving the office that day, I left a message for Dr.Derosa to please call me. The front desk girls response, \"I will have Linda, our manager give you a call.\" I said, \"No, I would appreciate it if you would have Dr DeRosa call me.\" I have never received her call. This was the second time I had left a message for her to call me. I would not refer anyone to DeRosa Medica. Please do your homework if you plan on making an appointment with this Medical Office! We are both looking forward to visiting with our new Dr.\n",

      "       I get a little nervous when I look at reviews for a business, any business, and nothing but severely negative reviews are written within a very short period of time. That is what I see here for DeRosa Medial. DeRosa Medical has helped bring sanity back to my life. I initially went to see them due to low testosterone. The nurse from my PCP goes to Dr. DeRosa for the pellet implants and has had no issues with them. I did not get the pellets because I could not afford the out of pocket cost. Instead, I used the cream. They were very attentive to my levels. I went for blood tests about every 6-weeks to confirm my levels were where they were supposed to be. I would get calls from them telling me they needed me to get the tests and to not delay any longer when life would get busy. As part of the initial evaluation, getting an ultrasound of your thyroid is standard procedure. It was during this scan they found a growth. It was very small and the medical profession tells people to take a \"wait and see\" attitude towards thyroid growths. My PCP and I went forward with a find needle aspiration. Turned out to be cancerous. When I got the call from Dr. DeRosa's office telling me they wanted to see me immediately, specifically the next morning, I knew it was cancerous. The entire office was so kind during this appointment. After that I was handed off to a surgeon for a total thyroidectomy and then to several Endocrinologists. Two and a half years of hell, post op, my thyroid levels were still not within range. Not to mention I was sleeping 18-hours a day, having major brain fog, among other issues. The Endo refused to run any other blood level tests separate from the thyroid levels to address these additional issues. I decided to return to Dr. DeRosa's office. With one visit, Jennifer ran six different blood levels test. Out of the six, I was deficient in five. She put me on the proper meds and things are better. I have seen three different PA's at her office and all of them have treated me exactly the same. The same professional attitude, attention to detail, they listen to patient complaints and take them seriously and then work to get to the bottom of the issues. They are my GO-TO medical office. I will confirm they had billing issues, but I was credited back for my over payments.\n",

      "       I had very high hopes for this team of doctors. Their website and accompanying accolades makes them sound so perfect for every woman struggling with hormonal imbalance. Let me tell you - this team does not know hormones. Beyond their inconsistent practices (every person I saw had a different strategy and miracle pill), the office is just unprofessional. They are always significantly late, the staff is evasive and the Office Manager was clueless regarding issues she should know about (insurance info). Every time I needed a prescription refill, it took minimally 1 full week to fill despite multiple attempts by the pharmacy to reach them. The pharmacist actually recommended that I find a new doctor. I have seen a lot of doctors due to hormonal problems and this was the worst practice I have been to to-date, :( Very disappointed.\n",

      "       Are you tired of going to the doctor, and after you've waited an extra 30 minutes to an hour after the time your appointment was scheduled, a nurse finally calls your name, weighs you, takes your blood pressure, and then leaves you alone for another 15 minutes or so, after which the doctor comes in, listens to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and then tells you that everything is fine without ever listening to what you have to say or asking how you feel? That's not what you get at DeRosa Medical. In fact, this is the type of place you think of when you read articles about doctors who treat celebrities or athletes. First of all, they are located in a very nice office building that doesn't feel like a doctor's office and you aren't going to find yourself in a waiting room fearing that you will get sick just from sitting next someone who appears to be at death's door. Secondly, they respect your time and aren't going to overbook. This is the first doctor's office I have ever visited where every appointment has actually started within 5 minutes of the time it was scheduled. Finally, this is where it gets good. They not only take your blood pressure and get your weight, they also draw your blood and do complete labwork when you start in order to get a baseline. And more importantly, they listen to your questions and concerns! I went in because no matter how much I went to the gym or what I did, I'd noticed my energy levels weren't what they used to be and I wanted to find out if this was just an irreversible part of aging or if something could be done. It turned out that my testosterone levels were low. The doctor answered all my questions about what that means, recommended Testosterone Replacement Therapy, wrote me a prescription and gave me a sample to get going immediately. Within a week I felt physically and mentally better than I had in years. I went back after 30 days to have my bloodwork done again and found that my testosterone levels are back up to normal with no negative side effects. In fact the only side effects are that I feel like a teenager and I am building muscle much easier than I ever have! I'll be going back in another three months to draw blood again and to make sure that everything stays good, and I appreciate that unlike most doctors they are actually interested in monitoring the long-term effects of their recommendations. The office works with both men and women and they take most major insurances, so if you want to counteract the effects of age or just want to go to see the best doctors you've ever met, go check out DeRosa Medical.\n",

After being told I would never wear contacts again, I thought my eyes were done for. I was then told I had severe dry eye, and should use drops. I stopped going to that eye doctor, and decided to get a consult for Lasik. Although I am not a candidate for the procedure, Doctor Ryff has done wonders for my eyes. She explained my dry eye disease, and has me wearing contacts to keep it from getting worse.\n",

I was a first time patient here, and my insurance was never asked for. They (she) ASSUMED I did not have insurance, and only AFTER I was finished with my appointment was this looked into. Furthermore, her demeanor was less than welcoming. What kind of business doesn't ask for insurance right away?? Had I known my CIGNA insurance was not welcome, I'd have IMMEDIATELY turned around. I feel gipped, and taken advantage of. I was given a discount for being a new patient, and paid $65 from the $117 they wanted to charge me. I will NEVER come here again, will NOT recommend people to visit here either. This company is SHADY!!!\n",

The Dr was friendly and did a quick but thrurough evaluation of my eyes. The best part and icing on the cake was Griselle. She was the associate who helps you pick out your glasses at the end. They have an assortment of high end frames but also some that were more affordable for a preschool teacher like myself. She was so on board with my budget and was so helpful in picking out frames. She looked at the shape of my eyes, my skin tone and how the frames complimented my natural features. It is so great to meet people who are amazing at their jobs and love what they are doing. We ended up finding an adorable pair that fit right into my budget. Love this office would reccomend it to anyone and everyone!\n",

As the previous client said, it's tucked away at the end of a residential neighborhood near Southern &amp; Rural on the NW side. When you walk in, you immediately notice how the office is so bright and cheerful and I was immediately greeted by someone at the desk. I was greeted by the lovely and friendly, Carrie. I was seated briefly to complete a few new patient forms - easy peasy. The environment was so fun and upbeat as they had their Sirius satellite music playing throughout the office. They have a variety of frames and sunglasses to choose from. Anna, one of the techs, took me back to do some of the pre-tests (how well eyes process light, evaluations, visual field screening, etc). She was so friendly and all of the equipment was very clean and the space was very organized. She then took me into the exam room where Dr Chow greeted me and performed several tests. Loved her energy and professionalism. Totally comfortable and asked her several questions she answered clearly. She explained everything clearly and didn't rush me through. After the exam she took me back to Carrie where she explained copays, options for contacts / glasses and scheduled another day for me to come in for trial fitting for contacts. I'm so glad I found this place! It's comfy-cozy, energetic &amp; caring staff and it's so conveniently close to home! I highly recommend this place for new clients!!! Thanks Desert Eye!!!\n",

They have pretty good hours and everyone seems to be happy to be there. When I first came in, they had machines that calibrated my eye pressure, color blindness and perception. After that I went in for my exam. My doctor was extremely thorough and made sure my contacts were perfect before I left. They even have a little section to shop for glasses. A man that assisted me with finding a pair was so enthusiastic. I had never thought that glass shopping could be so much fun! Plus my contacts and glasses came in a timely manner.

      "       It's rare you can walk into an office these days and actually feel like a person rather than a customer. I had my first appointment with Dr. Pearson recently, and I've already found myself recommending him to other friends of mine. I was interested in trying out various brands of contacts I'd heard about, and he was very accommodating, giving me generous samples to form my own opinions on. I asked about a brand of contacts that they didn't normally carry, and he ordered them specifically for me to try them out. I never felt like I was pressured into buying a certain brand because they were the most profitable for the business, and it's rare that you can go to a doctor these days that isn't trying to upsell you. Overall, the staff is great, and Dr. Pearson is a nice guy who seems to genuinely enjoy helping people through his line of work. I would definitely recommend visiting, and I will definitely be returning for future visits.\n",

The exam process is very thorough and the staff is very competent and helpful. I cannot say that I have ever enjoyed seeing doctors as a whole but this is one of very few exceptions. I always enjoy my visits and it is one of a few medical offices that I have need to visit that doesn't raise my blood pressure just to walk in the office.

I've been having some eye dryness and after visiting another doctor in the area who didn't treat me very respectfully (didn't give the time of day and was talking so quickly in medical jargon that made me feel so uncomfortable) I really wanted to find a place to get new glasses and new contacts that treated me like a person. From the front desk lady to the gentleman helping me pick out my glasses, I had the BEST experience. My doctor graciously and honestly sat with me and talked with me about ALL the ways that I could take care of my dry eyes and I could have cried because of her kindness to talk with me about everything.

      "       These guys were so awesome to me today. Dr. Cheng helped me a lot, and the girls from the front desk helped me sift through their zillions of eyeglass options. I got a couple of opinions from the different people there to figure out what would be best for me. They had fantastic customer service, really took their time with me, and listened to what I had to say. At first, I was a little unsure because the outside makes it look like you're walking into someone's house, but once inside you can see they have a beautiful facility and a fabulous staff. I only went here because it is very close to my house and they had good reviews-nice to see that they were so great!! I should also note that Dr. Cheng was very thorough with her exam, she had a calm and soothing voice so that was very nice. Once she was done, she thoroughly explained to me what's wrong with my eyes, told me about my prescription, when I should wear glasses, and she also was very knowledgable on my autoimmune disease and treatments and how those affect eyesight. I found that really impressive because I have been to MD's who have no clue how to pronounce even the name of my medications...she told me exactly what signs and symptoms to look for should I develop eyesight in conjunction to my Crohn's Disease/Arthritis flares. She was awesome!\n",

Let me explain: I was in the area on vacation and noticed one of my contact lenses was torn. I called a few optometrists to see if they had any samples they could provide me since I forgot to bring back-ups. The other places either didn't have my lens type or were not willing to help me out. Desert Eye was a different story. I had my doc fax over my Rx and they had a sample pair I could use. They saved my vacation! Thanks again!\n",

My parents and brother have been going to Desert Eye for years as well. Dr. Pearson is very knowledgeable as well as his staff. I was very pleased with the selection of glasses. During my most recent visit a few months ago, I couldn't decide between 2 pairs. Luckily, Matt was there to convince me that these gorgeous Gucci frames were the best fit for me. I am surprised to read about the logistical nightmare that W.H. had but I cannot recall this ever happening to me. I actually called the office the next day to compliment the staff on the wonderful customer service. The glasses arrived 2 weeks later and I have received many compliments. Thank you Desert Eye!\n",

      "       I have been seeing Dr. Pearson for the last 5 years or so and I have nothing but good things to say about him! He does a very thorough job, is very personable and really makes you feel comfortable. The other staff has always been super nice and very helpful. I feel no pressure to buy glasses if I don't want to, but they are there and willing to help out when I do want to. They offer me all of the extras and explain everything but I never feel pressured to buy if I don't want to and if I say no, they just move on. Some of their frames are more expensive, but I find that when I do fork over a little more they hold up better and I don't have to replace them as often and ultimately I'm just happier with them. My son (7 years old) recently had his first eye appointment with Dr. Pearson as well and everyone was so good with him. I liked that they talked to him, not just me, and really went out of their way to make him comfortable (he was a little nervous). The lady who helped him pick out his glasses was amazing and didn't seem at all impatient with his indecision. These folks are great, and I encourage you to go down and give them a chance. I don't know what happened with the previous reviewer, but it seems to me that you just can't please some people. I have had nothing but great experiences in the years that I've gone here and I'm sure you will too!\n",

I had called 3 places total yesterday and felt no need to follow up on the other tattoo removal shops. When I arrived, he was all set up and ready to go. He answered all my questions but the one thing I was impressed with was he kept me engaged in conversation during the process so I wouldn't focus on the pain. I'm hopeful it will lighten enough after one session for my tattoo cover up to proceed but if not, I know I'm in good hands for the follow up session(s).\n",

The complex that he is in is a bit of a maze, but it's all clearly signed if you just walk around a bit. I had been communicating with him via text, and he was always quick to respond. He got me in right away and within a short amount of time (maybe 20-30min total time?) I was done and on my way. He's really easy to talk to and answered all my questions (I ask a lot!).

Craig made sure I was informed about the process and made it as quick and comfortable as possible - which is saying something because, as someone who suffers major anxiety and panic attacks, it's no easy task to make me comfortable.

I waited a couple weeks to write this review to see how my arm healed up and it's healed up very nice I highly recommend this place in every aspect from start to finish\n",

      "       I was a dumb young kid and made some poor decisions when a friend of mine decided he was going to tattoo out of a double wide trailer. Fast forward almost 10 years and now I felt was the time to get rid of the horrible tattoo on my neck behind my ear. I heard good things about East Valley Tattoo Removal so I gave them a shot. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. I have plenty of tattoos but have never got laser removal done and don't really know too much about the process. Craig was really nice and knowledgable and helpful throughout the whole process. The tattoo I needed removed is pretty small so i finished my first session and was in and out it what seemed like under 10 minutes. I have a few more sessions left until it is completely gone but there's already a huge difference after only one session. I highly recommend this place to anyone who needs a bad tattoo removed or lighted up enough to be covered up.\n",

      "       Horrible experience yesterday. My girl friends bought me a groupon for my birthday to go get a massage. So yesterday I called to set an appt. The man that answered seemed nice. I explained that I had a groupon and gave him the groupon number. He said thank you and booked the appt. I drove 30 minutes to go over there. Once I got there he greeted with a smile but then told me he couldn't find the groupon number in his system. No record of it. I gave him the print out and after about 10 minutes he finally says \"oh I know, you got this groupon from our expired account, I cannot honor it. \" WTF? He continued to explain that if I wanted to I could go on the new groupon account and purchase a new offer and he would give me a discount. I considered it. I had just driven across town and was totally looking forward to a massage and paraffin treatment. I asked several times what that would include and at what cost and he just kept saying \"I'll give you discount. I'll give you good deal\" no answer . He said to contact groupon for a refund and pay for the massage there. I explained it was a gift and his answer was \"call your friends and tell them to get a refund and give you the money back!\" How rude! I walked out very upset. Thumbs way down! Too bad I have to put at least 1 star. Update: The response from this company is an insult. 1. If groupon does give a refund it would not go to me. It was a gift. That means I would have to pay out of pocket. 2. I never did get a real answer. If I paid out of pocket, what package would I get and how much would it cost? 3. I never said the guy was rude. He was very nice and smiley. BUT he did not solve the problem. He was clueless .I called hours before I went and gave him the voucher number and description of the groupon as well as my name and the giftgivers name. I also explained that I was 30 minutes away. He could have told me over the phone that there was an issue and saved me time and gas and frustration. 4. Most importantly, please do not insinuate that I am a liar! He did in fact, suggest that i buy my own package and contact my friends to get a refund and give me the money back. And since it was only he and I in the front office you cannot say with any certainty that it did not happen. I think it would be rude to call my friends and say \"hey the groupon did not work so I got my own package now you gotta give me cash.\" That's not ok with me. I have the printout that states that the monetary value is with this spa and can be used towards other services from the merchant if the coupon expires or is removed. Today my friend got an email stating that the coupon has been extended to July 21 and can still be used.\n",

      "       Worst massage I've ever had and I went to school for it . Let me start by saying the woman on the phone was rude and even when I came for my appointment she was short and not friendly . With the massage itself I felt like I was just getting oil rubbed in . No pressure and didn't even ask how the pressure was . She s chewing gum like a cow and burping . Felt like I had a frat boy in the room . Woman put no effort Into it and even sat down on the bed on top of my fingers and rubbed my leg with little to no effort . All she did was push on me and ignore all the knots she clearly could feel since she would move to another area right away. Didn't bother massaging my neck, shoulders or hips . Not only that she kept leaving the room 5xs to be exact . You should have all you need set up in the room especially if I have an appointment . It just kept getting worse . I'm in more pain from her pushing on me then when I went in there . It was supposed to be a Swedish massage . Was more like some towel boy putting sunscreen on me . At the end of the massage she got in my face and said okay massage over startled the shit out of me . Try whispering! After my crappy lack of a massage I went to the bathroom didn't even make it back up to the front to check out and she goes uh my tip..... WHO DOES THAT . Your sign says up front appreciated not required . I'm not a person not to tip but she def lowered her tip straight up asking for it . I shouldn't have even tipped the service was the worst I've ever had . I should of had her stop ten min into after hearing her coughing all over me but I was hoping it would get better boy was I wrong . Oh and one last thing I don't know why they think this is acceptable but DO NOT PUSH MY TEMPLES IN I even made a face of pain and she pushed harder and that was the most pressure she applied the whole massage . She should retire or go back to the foot reflexology places . Glad it was a Groupon and I didn't bother wasting the 125$ they charge for that service . NEVER AGAIN . Stay away you are better off having your 5 year old massage you .\n",

      "       We were in Vegas celebrating our 20th anniversary. My husband got me a package here for a massage and facial. The facial was FANTASTIC. She was their only saving grace. Check in was fine. But the masseuse has a lot to learn. First, if my husband paid for an hour massage, I expect that. I know it is typically 50 minutes because of prep work. But she kept leaving the room. Her strokes were sloppy, inconsistent. She spent more time massaging my arms than my upper body and neck. No lower back work, strokes ranged from not feeling it to wincing in pain. The only time she asked me was I okay was when she hopped on my back, which I almost flipped her over. I didn't know what the hell she was doing. When I checked out, I only tipped the aesthetician. The check out person kept telling me about tipping the masseuse, I told her I was not tipping her, I was not happy with the service she provided and therefore was not tipping her. She needs to be retrained!\n",

If you get the big package, just know that the scrub and \"mud wrap\" occur during the \"60 minute\" massage. The mud wrap just seemed to be having your back covered in whatever it was with sheets of Saran Wrap (that were ripped from the roll, quite clumsily, and loudly) that were place on top of the \"mud.\" The facial was pretty good for what it was.

Found this place on Groupon offering a great deal, and was able to book a couple's massage for way less than a single elsewhere! Before buying the Groupon, we called to make sure they would be able to accommodate us, since we were only in town one more day. When we called, the lady asked which Groupon we were looking at, and told us not to worry about buying the Groupon, she would just charge us that rate. I was honestly skeptical after reading a few other reviews, but they kept their word and honored the price no questions asked. Now for the best part- the massages! While it may not have been a true, side by side \"couples\" experience, as we were in separate treatment rooms, we didn't care, we both got AWESOME massages! Full body coverage, hot stones, great pressure, and responsive to trouble zones. For a couple of tiny little ladies, they had some powerful hands! My neck and shoulders had been so tight the day before that it hurt when I pressed on them, by the time I left Elante, I was relaxed and pain free. The place was super clean and comfortable, great service, very friendly, and the price was AWESOME! Don't waste your money at the fancy hotel spas- go to Elante!

So they honored my price for a walk in today... and it was phenomenal. It was quiet, with relaxing music. The hot stones were absolutely amazing! Just hot enough. The masseuse I had for my massage was so nice and she listened to exactly what I asked for!! She took her time and made sure I was 150% satisfied. I was SO relaxed that I felt like it was an out of body! The same goes for my facial masseuse. She was incredibly nice and she gave me exactly the perfect type of facial for my skin.

When I called up to check if I could use a Groupon for a couples massage for $79, the lady who answered the phone told me that I will be charged taxes and fees on top of the groupon, and they have a special going on for $99 and it would be best if I went for that instead. Why advertise on groupon when they say it will be more expensive? 2. I booked a 60 minutes massage, but end to end they finished in 45 mins. 3. Although the massage felt good, I couldnt smell the lavendar oil I had selected after the massage. Felt like I had never gotten one! The oils must be of the cheap variety with no lingering aroma. 4. The ladies had the audacity to ask me to tip them $10 each, as that was the going rate for couples massage. I flat out refused, and tipped them $5 each. 5. The location is in a seedy strip mall away from the strip. 6. They claimed that their credit card machine was not working and asked me to pay cash, for which I received no receipt.

      "       I didn't actually have any services at Elante, as they wouldn't honor my Groupon unless I paid an additional $24. I visited Las Vegas last weekend, and wanted to get a massage and facial, but I didn't want to pay the exorbitant prices charged by the big casino hotels. So I checked up on Groupon to see if any Las Vegas spas were offering deals and found one for Elante (found two, actually). I checked them out on Yelp, saw all the good reviews, and thought they sounded like a good deal. I called them first before I bought the Groupon to make sure they could accommodate an appointment for when I was in LV. I told the receptionist who answered the phone several times that I planned on using a Groupon. She informed me they charged the same price ($99 for a 60-minute facial + 60-minute massage) whether or not you used the Groupon, which made me wonder if the \"savings\" they identified on the Groupon (I think it was \"a $240 value!\" or something like that) was real. False advertising? I don't know. But I told her I wanted to use the Groupon (because i just didn't quite trust that pricing without a documented coupon). She booked the appointment for me, but when I arrived for it and reminded her I had a Groupon for it, she said it would be an extra $24 \"tax\" (she also called it a \"surcharge\" I think). I said I wasn't going to pay it, that the Groupon indicated it was paid in full, and I had not received any notice on the emailed confirmation they sent me that there would be an extra charge. She refused to budge, and actually waved a stack of printed Groupon vouchers at me as if that would convince me. So I cancelled the appointment, called a cab and went back to my hotel. If you plan on using a Groupon at this place, I advise you to rethink that.\n",

They were on time, courteous, and did a great job! Salon is quiet, relaxing, and clean. Very relaxing after walking so much on the strip. My suggestion is to ride the city bus from the strip, (Tropicana route, $5.00 for 24 hours, as opposed to nearly $40 cab ride) than pay the excessive charges by the taxis.\n",

I think the next time I visit I will do 90 min rather than 60 min. The music is just the right volume and tone to relax you and it smells great in there, I like places that put effort in to the details, it shows they care. The massuse I had was Lisa and she may be one of the best I have experienced. She seemed to be able to massage deep into the muscle but without hurting me. When I left I think I litteraly felt lighter! Will definately be back, Thanks, Lisa\n",

      "       Elante spa is a great option for quality spa services at an affordable price. A friend and I went to this spa while on our girls getaway weekend and the services received were excellent. I had the 60 min aromatherapy and hot stone massage with paraffin hand and foot treatment. My masseuse was very thorough, applied the right amount of pressure and asked if I had any problem areas where I needed her to focus. I should also mention that it was very easy to schedule with Elante and we were taken back for our services within 5 mins of entering the location. The facility is clean and comfortable. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the walls are very thin so I could hear talking in the hallway but not enough to ruin my experience. The staff was very attentive and really give great service. I highly recommend and will go back myself on future visits to Las Vegas. If you just want great service without the fluff, frills and price tag of more expensive spas...this is the place for you.\n",

      "       Got a one hour deep tissue massage from a lady named May. Worst massage ever. No technique whatsoever. I told her twice I wanted deep tissue. The entire massage consisted of her putting excess amounts of oil on me and rubbing it into my skin. So much oil that the hot stones were just sliding off of my back. She didn't massage my hands or feet, she squeezed my neck so many times that it's still sore two days later. I should have just gotten up mid massage and ended it, but I was already naked and lathered up in what I hope was oil. Also, I was hoping it would get better, never happened. After the massage I asked for the manager (who wasn't there), so I told May and her co-worker that I'm not paying full price for a 1/2 massage where my feet and hands don't get massaged and also, a massage that is far from Deep or Tissue. They explained to me that if I wanted my feet or hands done, I'd have to specifically pay for the hand and foot massage. What type of full body massage doesn't include hands and feet? I've never heard of such thing in my life. Also, no stretching either. So I'm not sure if these people are even licensed. May knew nothing about the skeletal or muscular system. I could have just walked out without paying her anything. But I paid for the massage anyway because I felt so bad for her. She actually defended her \"massage\". Don't waste your time and money there.\n",

I got Facial and Massage combo and I was in heaven :) Made appointment for 3 pm and they were waiting for me when I got there, didn't have to wait at all, even though I wouldn't have minded, the reception area was super cute :) I was taken to the Massage first and I can't say how much I love how clean it is every thing is brand new and they must have the most comfortable and sturdy massage tables in LV! great massage and they even did aroma thereapy where it came up through the hole in the table when i was face down... they let me pick what smell i like and I got eucalyptus with lavender was awesome, helps me breath better when lay face down, Thanks Tina! after my dreamy massage, a different lady came in, I think her name was May. She was also great and now my face feels so wonderful! I've had facials before, but not like this. Her tecnique is so flawless and gentle... I actually feel younger! I'm going back soon for sure, very affordable thanks again!\n",

Then perhaps you should come visit the man with the magic hands, Dr Sanchez at Freestone Chiropractic! It's only $30 for your initial consultation adjustment and X-ray included, which is the only time you'll need to schedule an appontment. After that it's just $15 per visit with no appointment or insurance needed, open Monday through Saturday until 6pm you can't beat it! I've been going to Freestone since before the dinosaurs roamed the earth. They've treated me, my Mom, Step-Dad and even my little miss after she took a face plant off the monkey bars at school. I knew I could trust them to handle my princess with care. They're always personable, never pushy on trying to get you in on the daily, and they let you decide how often to come in. After a few auto accidents (not my fault) and wearing bad wedges occasionally (short girl issues) I need to be put back into place. I see Dr Sanchez because he is fabulous, knows what he's doing, and can figure out where I'm hurtng without me saying a word. He is there on Saturday, Tuesday and Thursdays which works with my crazy schedule. Dr Meade is there on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays and word on the street from other Yelp peeps is he's awesome too! You won't be cured after one visit, perfection takes time but I always feel better walking out than when I walked in. So if you're feeling out of whack and need some work on your neck or back, Freestone is the place to go!\n",

      "       Freestone Chiropractic on Southern Avenue in Mesa is a truly great deal! I'm surprised that they do not have more advertising. I was so lucky to have found them by driving by and reading their sign. Freestone is the CHEAPEST CHIROPRACTOR office that I have personally found in East Valley. You pay $30 for their first visit which includes an X ray, and exam by the doctor. Then each visit is by cash or credit card for ONLY $15 AN OFFICE VISIT! This is even cheaper than my former Tucson chiropractor. I believe that Lincoln Chiropractic in East Valley costs $20 a visit, but Freestone is still the best! I have a scoliosis disorder and I need regular adjustments to keep my spine aligned. I am so VERY GRATEFUL for Freestone. Dr. Meade is also a great doctor and he manipulates me on the table with his hands. I feel so good when I get off the table. Dr. Meade is a very gifted chiropractor and he is only in the office on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 8AM to 6PM. The other chiropractor, Dr. Sanchez is there on Tuesday, Thursdays, and Saturdays. I really prefer Dr. Meade and I try to spread the word to friends. I could not even begin to afford what these other clinics in East Valley charge. I will be so upset if I ever have to move across town or change my work schedule. At least for now I can save my money and I go twice a month, instead of just once a month with another doctor. Plus, if you give a referral card to a friend and they actually get an appointment, then you get a free session with the doctor! Thanks for reading!\n",

The old stuff a lady was proficient and quick a new lady was so slow and took my order for more than 5 minutes, told me wrong information and did not understand, remember names on the menu. Definitely, need more training before going for serve. The bowl originally came with no protein, but she told me I could select any one of those. But in fact, the total price for add a little chicken and steak would be $5.48 before tax which was a bit pricey. Still, consider Chipotle has better value and Mexican style(even not that \"real\" as some great restaurant.) For this meal below I paid $22.12.\n",

      "       Freshii is a small counter-served restaurant located at McCord Hall at the W.P. Carey School of Business on the Arizona State University Tempe Campus. It has tables for two and some outdoor tables, but all the food is served in compost packaging which allows for easy transport elsewhere. Freshii is always busy in the morning and during lunch, but on average I only wait 5 to 10 minutes to get served by their friendly staff. Their menu is varied consisting of salads and wraps, bowls, burritos, soups, frozen yogurt, breakfast, juices and smoothies, breakfast items, and even customized meals that you can create yourself. I love how on their menu they put the calories on each of their menu items. I found the restaurant to be bright and clean, and the service appropriately quick, but music is sometimes too loud to easily order. I love the Teriyaki Twist bowl and maybe someday I will try some of their other foods on the menu. It contains edamame, broccoli, green onions, teriyaki sauce, sesame seeds, carrots, wontons, brown rice, and cucumbers. I always buy the bowl without the cucumbers since I don't like them. Freshii gives you the option to add hormone free protein to your meal such as chicken, which is what I prefer. The chicken and broccoli are always cold and the next time I visit I am going to check to see if it can be served hot. On the other hand, the brown rice served with the chicken and broccoli burnt my tongue! I wish that the carrots were thicker or in greater quantity as the grated carrots they use are few and far between. The green onions are pungent and will affect your breath negatively so I would not recommend ordering them unless you are going straight home or to a place you can brush and gargle. Receiving the correct order has been a bit of an issue as I have had one occasion where they gave me cucumbers when I specifically requested none, and recently I received no edamame with my meal. The price of the Teriyaki Twist Bowl is $6.99, and adding the optional chicken increases the price by $1.99. As much as I enjoy the food, the price of $8.98 plus tax is prohibitive for me as a college student to eat there often. I wish the price could be lower as not only do I wish to continue eating more organic and hormone-free foods, but I strongly wish to try more of their diverse menu. On average, most meal choices are going to cost you approximately $10. It is comforting to come into an eatery where they know you by name, smile, and provide you with a natural, healthy and appealing nutritional fare. Personally, I would recommend Freshii to anyone who is seeking a healthier diet or more diverse food choices.\n",

To sum this place up, imagine a less efficient Chipotle with incompetent student workers, NOT fresh ingredients, slow service, and what seems to be no training from management. I could strap on an apron and gloves and make my own meal faster than the employees here. If you have any food allergies, definitely do NOT come here to eat, as requesting any ingredient to be excluded from your meal will simply go ignored. I might note that this is my third negative experience here. The allure of the location outside the MU is very nice and seating options are plentiful, but I rather go hungry than to give this place a 4th chance to prove me wrong.\n",

      "       UPDATE AFTER A SECOND VISIT: Upon further inspection, it seems to me that although they advertise as being healthy (and generally are), almost all of their meals are high in fat content. And since they don't allow you to \"Create Your Own\" anything, there's only so much you can do to fix that. Now on to my experience... Employee seemed uninterested in me until the last second. When I gave my order, I was spoken to in a clipped way that made me feel like she didn't care, or just wanted to get it over with. I don't need any special service, but it was a bit off-putting. Asked for kale instead of spinach/romaine. Paid extra for said kale. Still got spinach/romaine (I got it as take-out so didn't notice until I was at my later destination). Asked for no dressing. It was SMOTHERED in dressing, so much so that most of my salad was soggy by the time I got to eat it. No, this place isn't terrible. It's fine. But the customer service and menu versatility seems to be seriously lacking. I have dropped my review from 3 to 2 stars because of my combined experiences. ORIGINAL REVIEW: Tried this place post workout between classes because I wanted a healthier option. There was another girl having problems with her order because she wanted a smaller portion (the portions are pretty huge, I will admit). One of the employees told her that the wrap was a smaller portion, so she asked for the wrap without a tortilla. The other employee couldn't get it through her head that that wasn't to be rung up as a salad. In the end, the first employee ended up giving her the smaller salad as a \"wrap,\" but it was a lot of grief over something pretty simple. I like that they have healthy options. It's weird that they have everything set up like a health-food Chipotle, but they don't let you just customize whatever you want - you have to pick something off the menu and then you can switch a couple things around if you wanna have the conversation with them about it. There are a lot of proteins and \"superfoods,' like kale, that you can add for like a dollar. I did that, but I have to say, $8.47 is a little on the pricy side for a salad, even if it was pretty big. I asked for dressing on the side and there was still dressing put on the salad. Oh well. I'm not really a big complainer, and it was good-tasting dressing anyways They shake up the salads for you, which I actually kind of liked because I hate it when all the toppings are gone in the first few bites. It was a good salad, the superbiotic one. I was more or less satisfied. Oh, and they take M&amp;G. So I'll probably be back.\n",

The same smoothie that used to be thick and purple/red comes out green or light green and is the consistency of water. If I ask them to make it thicker they just mess it up more. If it happened every once in awhile I would be like mistakes happen, but it seems to happen on a regular basis. I do not go there as much as I used to because I am taking a chance on wasting my money. It is too expensive to take the chance that it might come out right. I would rather go to whole foods or 24 carrots for a smoothie where it comes out the same every time, even though I love the oxidation smoothie when it comes out right.\n",

      "       Wow! Hubby and I spotted this place a week ago when we were used-car shopping in the neighborhood (there are two big auto malls on Gilbert and Val Vista just north of the 202). Unfortunately it was closed for the evening that day, but we vowed to return. Luckily, tonight when we went to pick up the car we decided to buy, it was earlier in the evening and they were still open. We popped in and were extremely pleasantly surprised by what we found. Clean, fresh and friendly is how I would describe the place, the staff and the food. It's all extremely simple, healthy ingredients, including plenty of vegetarian and even vegan options (hubby is vegetarian and I'm mostly vegetarian). Hubster had the Mediterranean Sea bowl with brown rice, and I had the quinoa macaroni-and-cheese dish with edamame for my protein. So delicious, portion size not too big and not too small, and even the beverages were awesome. I had the \"Immunization Station\" smoothie (banana, apple, strawberry, kale, etc.) and hubster had the cold-brew coffee with agave. Can you say YUM-O!?! This place proves you don't have to sacrifice taste for clean, healthful eating. Even though it's a fair distance from where we live, we will definitely go out of our way to return and try some of the other wonderful looking things on the menu.\n",

      "       So we live in Tempe but drove to Gilbert for smoothies and juice. I was appalled to find out that if you do not want ice you be served a smaller size than what you ordered. I paid for a large but received a smaller cup size still with some ice. My question is exactly how many ounces of juice do we actually receive in a 16 ounce cup? Maybe that should be listed on your menu. I feel deceived. Neither Jamba Juice or Chop Shop do this and they are much closer to me. Lesson learned.\n",

      "       First time at this particular Grabbagreen, been to the one in North Scottsdale a couple of times. Couple of things, walked in the door two individuals behind the counter, one helping a customer at the register with a GC, the other standing there doing nothing. No acknowledgment no what can I get started for you, just continues to stand there and then says Hi to the person who walked in 5 mind after me. So I order a $7.50 Smoothie, Pina Protein, with donation it costs be $9. Damn that is expensive, but ok. Get it quickly enough take a drink and start choking a bit. Pina Protein is Coconut, Pineapple, Agave and Whey Protein and Coconut Water. Each drink I take I end up coughing right after, way to much Whey. So I end up only drinking half of it and head to my yoga class where I get nauseous about half way through. I had planned on finishing up my smoothie after but it went directly into the trash. Not sure I will be back, I understand eating healthy is not cheap but I would rather go to Nekter for my smoothie fix.\n",

      "       First time eating here, really cool concept if you are looking for something healthy other than a salad. The manager was really friendly and proficient in the menu. The food does come in a small box, but it filled me up quite a bit! For something healthy with a lot of organic stuff which is trying to give their customers portion control at the same time, I can see why their prices are a little higher. Love that you are able to easily modify the dishes, my Chicken Mac and Cheese (sorry i don't know the right name) was delicious. Had an opportunity to try the PB and J with Whey and it was really good too. The protein wasn't overpowering and you always got good flavor with it and it come's in a good size too. I live super close by and will definitely be back to get more protein smoothies after a workout and to explore the other options on their menu :)\n",

Cici made me feel very comfortable and relaxed during the treatment. Reflexology may just be the closest you can get to heaven on earth. My feet &amp; lower legs feel energized and refreshed. I also had the mini hand, scalp, shoulder and neck massage. It was wonderful. Typically, these type of treatments can be expensive. Not at Green Spring! Good price point for full 60 minute session.\n",

      "       I don't think this place is professional at all. I bought a Groupon to this place and upon arriving, I encountered a person that i wasn't able to communicate with at all. We worked through the barrier and I was hurried into a room to start my massage. She comes in and starts the massage and 10 minutes into it she stops abruptly to go help a new patron. She leaves me for about 5 minutes to sign the patron in and comes back and continues. 5 minutes into it, there is a knock on the door and the massage is interrupted by her co worker. They proceed to have a 3 - 4 minute conversation and in the mean time im not getting a massage. The co worker shuts the door and leaves. 10 minutes later another knock on the door and it's another co worker. This one wanted my Groupon code. She walks into my session and demanded I provide her with my Groupon code, so I jump off the table, get my phone and give her my Groupon. This takes a good 5 minutes. She leaves happy to have gotten my Groupon code. Exactly 5 minutes before my hour is out, my therapist is done. Imagine my frustration. Here I am, I just paid for a 60 minute massage and these people wasted close to half of my time. I wanted to complain, but my therapist can't understand a word that I say. I can't even consider coming here again. Bad business practices.\n",

      "       Whoa! Terrible place. Smelled like I just came out of a brothel afterwards. Unprofessional massage. You should never massage directly on the backbone; that could cause permanant damage. Came out with a horrendous headache!! Also, very rough. Cut your nails people. I have never been scratched so badly in my life, never scratched during a massage before period. They switched the person doing the massage halfway through. Also massage person was frequently talking on the phone in another language during the massage. Even left her cell phone on the table at the end. Tried to ask for a different price at the end than what was quoted on the phone, but finally relented and told me not to tell anyone. WTF? No other massage experience even compares to how horrible the experience was.\n",

      "       This was by far the worst experience I've ever had. If I could give it zero stars, I would. My friend and I went to get massages and after making our appointment, they called my friend back to push the time back. When we got there the lights were off and the women barely spoke English, which made the process even more challenging. They tried to tell us to leave and come back, but then decided we should stay and they would start instead of making us leave. The one woman was very kind and kept hugging us. Once our \"massages\" started the two women rubbed our backs for an hour. They kept leaving the room during our session. Finally, once it was all over, we told the women we were paying separately with two cards. She proceeded to ring up both massages on my card. I'm not sure how this place remains open, with how poor the experience was.\n",

      "       I have used Yelp for food for some time, but get disappointed when trying to find non food services on yelp, as i feel many people create accounts and do one review and that is it...how can i trust that? So trust me when I say, this is a great Urgent Care facility. I had the flu and after a week of it not being completely gone, I went in just to make sure all was well. The place is clean. The staff was amazingly friendly. I truly got the feeling they cared for my well being. I went on a Saturday afternoon and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes to get seen. I was in and out in under 30 minutes and got the answers I was seeking. If looking for an Urgent Care facility, check this place out.\n",

      "       I really liked this urgent care for several reasons. First, I called ahead to ensure they accepted my insurance, and the guy at the front desk was SUPER helpful and very pleasant to speak with, explaining to me that they do take it and going into detail about the specific plan I have (it's a plan under Tricare and UnitedHealth) and why some people do not accept it because it used to be called a different name. Anyways, he really seemed to know his stuff and was happy to inform me of all this. When I did arrive, he remembered this and made sure that everything would be okay insurance wise, and that I would not be saddled with a huge bill due to miscommunication. Second, the wait time was outstanding in that there was basically none at all. I was in and out of this place within about fifteen minutes. When you're not feeling well and just want to go home and lay down, being efficient and speedy is a huge plus. Lastly, the doctor (her name was Rosa Banuelos, MD) really listened to me and my concerns, especially when I told her that the antibiotic that she originally wanted to prescribe was one that has never worked for me. Sometimes doctors will think they know you best and will prescribe something anyways, not listening to what you have to say. She asked why it didn't work and together we came up with a better solution for me, which meant an alternate antibiotic, which of course I was very pleased with. She's a sweet lady too, so her demeanor also put me at ease. I'll definitely be visiting again when I do get sick in the future.\n",

      "       1st experience with IV therapy, and what a beautiful experience it was! Called today to get an appt (like for RIGHT NOW!!) after a wasted trip to the Dr's today (Have been sick for 2weeks now), and the Dr's did NOTHING for me. I was out of my mind DONE! Got on our friendly Google and found IV Revival on the 1st site. So glad I called. Heather (I hope I'm remembering correctly? Our sweet New Yorker), and she squeezed me in today. Ashley showed up right on time, not that I would have cared that my Angel of liquids would have been late. And whaaalaaa. I'm now full of lot's of good stuff and hopefully wake up tomorrow feeling fabulous? It certainly can't hurt. I opted for the $175 package, adding in Curcumin for an ex $25, and a $20 tip for Ashley. I know it's sounds pricey, but it's our health! A night of drinking and dinner .... cost more. Check it out .... even if you start with a simple less expensive therapy ..... your gonna be hooked! Looking forward to my next one\n",

Shelby arrived on time, she was discreet, professional and painless. I didn't feel a thing. After my infusion, I felt 100% better. It's amazing what IV Revival can do. Thank you for hydrating me and making me better.\n",

      "       IV Revival saved me last night. I was extremely ill and didn't keep anything down for over 24 hours and couldn't even get water in. Matt sent a message late in the day to IV Revival. Tony called us in a timely manner and despite our inquiry being close to end of business for them, he got a nurse scheduled to come out right away. She arrived and explained everything, got my IV going with a cocktail to help with muscle soreness and nausea along with vitamins and minerals. Within 15 minutes I could feel a bit of relief and by the time she was done I could feel my body relax. My muscle cramping dissipated. I slept well but woke up feeling very dehydrated still. So, I booked another appointment for 8:30am. The nurse showed up timely and he quickly got me going and it made a huge difference. By noon today I started feeling human again and ate for the first time since Thursday night this evening. Had I not used their service I would have ended up in the ER for dehydration. I highly recommend this company and my only regret is that I didn't call them at the onset of the flu. The most amazing thing is I was in the comfort of my own bed. Thank you all! I'll have their cards handy at the next party we host they also help people with hangovers\n",

Irina was at my house in less than 30 mins, she gave me the easiest line I've ever had, no bruises. Irina had a great attitude the whole time and when I started to become ill, she did everything she could to make me feel better. Now what blew me away about revive is their follow up. I paid my ducats, they easily could've sent me a generic email in a week, but they personally reached out. I ended up going to the er, for more fluids and to make sure I wasn't dying, and revive was instrumental in helping me advocate for proper care. Thanks guys\n",

I was hooked up to an IV and treatment was done within 30minutes. No more emergent visits to the pocelain goddess or pounding headache and was able to catch up on a few more zzzzzz's.

Dr Ha found a major issue with my eyes that was not treated by other optometrists and very detrimental to my eyesight. He is treating it aggressively and actually decided not to waste my time with doing an eyeglass exam that would have been worthless unlike the others until this issue is handled. I applaud him for that!! The staff is courteous and knowledgeable and made me feel at ease from the moment I walked in. The office is clean and inviting. I have already recommended this location to my family to make the change from their current eye doctors to this group. Do yourselves a favor and give them a try!\n",

Obviously i am freaked out, i don't have vision insurance, and i don't know what to do. ...Well vision source was the perfect place to go! The doctors were so nice and the two ladies at the front desk really made the experience perfect. They could answer every single question I had with confidence and clarity such that sometimes a phone call could take the place of me having to come all the way in! I wish i could remember their names so i could give them a proper shout out, but if you go in you will know immediately who i am talking about. Not to mention they made the transition to a contact lens to glasses (when i didnt like the contact thing) so easy and painless! I thought it was going to be such a troublesome moneypit but instead, it was so easy (and i left with plenty of money still in mu pockets!). So i guess what i am saying is if you ever go blind in one eye, this is the place to go! Haha. But seriously, I love this place!!\n",

They are open during hours I can actual get there without having to take time off work. I like that you are in and out quickly too, but they still take the time to evaluate your needs and provide excellent service. Dr. Kim Larsen gives a really amazing massage right on the spine that always leave me feeling great. I also like that they don't push you to come in EVERY week. Their goal is to get you feeling good then keep you feeling good! You can usually easily call in for an appointment too!\n",

      "       Do not use the J. Woodson dermatology for any cosmetic procedures. For a month and a half the office on Pecos called me about 2 treatments left on a lip blast package I bought a year ago and had no expiration date. I called to make an appointment they said to come in on Tuesday, August 30, 2016. They asked where would you like the treatment the belly? I said legs. Their response was good you have two treatments left. Well, Tuesday did not work because they could not get the machine at the Pecos location. So they rescheduled me to Thursday, September 1, 2016. I told them the 2:00 pm is tight with a daughter's physical therapy appointment. They said No problem and it only takes 30 minutes. I agreed. So on Thursday I was asked fill out forms and agree to lip blast. I waited 30 minutes and they finally came to the window and told me that I have no treatments left and they don't have record that I ever paid for the treatments. What a joke? I said, Why did you call me if I had two treatments left and why did you tell me when I made the appointment that I still had those two treatments. No one could answer me and I got ripped off. I will seek further help in getting my money back. Consumers need to stay away...\n",

      "       The front office staff of any office is usually the first contact with any client, patient, or customer; and most often reflects the kind of care you'll get once inside. Considering this assumption to be true, this doc just DOES NOT CARE! I can say with no reservation his front office practice is the worst I've seen in my 62 years! (1) Their phone \"service\" does not work and you'll NEVER talk to a human being...all I wanted to know was the cross streets to be sure I didn't go to his ex-relative's practice....geeze, louise... (2) I arrived to my appt 15 minutes (10 minutes minimum.) Receptionist claimed their phone \"service\" called me day yesterday and claimed they verbally confirmed with me that I was to be there 1/2 hour early. This never happened. Even when I showed her my phone records from their office, the only record was the day I made the appt WEEKS AGO!!!...geeze, louise... (3) Receptionist claimed that Doc said he would NOT honor appt even though it was his lack of care in patient communication that caused the error in \"service.\" Doctor J. Woodson, maybe you forgot that health concerns are often first revealed to be dangerous health issues via the skin, the largest organ of the human body. It should not be dismissed so readily because YOUR PHONE SYSTEM SUCKS! It was YOUR FAULT, YOUR PHONE SERVICE, and YOUR LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE PATIENT that makes me write this review. Shame on you \"Doctor\" J. Woodson. I made a respectful effort to be on time. I futilely tried calling your office multiple times. I was on time. How dare you! My concerns are NOT fleeting, but yours are. Shame, shame, shame.\n",

      "       Dr. Woodson is brilliant, amazing and generous. I was diagnosed w/ psoriatic arthritis and he had been the 6th doctor I went to, before I was correctly diagnosed. He spends 45-1.5 hours with me in each appointment. He is also incredibly generous, not only with his time, but with his business. He has given me plenty of free samples, a free laser peel, and much more. More importantly he cares and is always willing to listen. His staff however is a different story. Ive been w/ Dr. Woodson for 4-5 years now, and I can't remember how many times his staff have turned over. They either forget my appointment, forget what the appointment is for, or do not update my file. They do not return phone calls and do not follow-up with the patient. Dr. J Woodson is carrying his office by himself. I wish he had better staff. But the doc himself is wonderful!\n",

The world needs to know what they do is wrong. I have been a member of yelp a long time. I give good reviews and I give bad. Sometimes we don't like what customers say so J Woodson has even contacted yelp lied to them to get the bad review removed. The fact of the matter is you can't descriminate against or mistreat a patient because of their military status, or that they are using a military insurance card etc etc etc.\n",

      "       I too wish I could give zero stars..I saw this dr a couple yrs ago..leslie jacobs..she was very business like..and ordered tons of tests except for what I went in for..I kept questioning it and the nurses? told me the dr required it as she'd never seen me before. So I figured they'd get to my actual problem which was a hip leg pain. They finally took an xray and recommended a specialist. I went to the dr they recommended snd he was a shoulder specislist?? He seemed puzzled as to why I was there and tried to help me but said I should really see a hip specialist and get an mri which he could order and just happened to be at their facility. In the meantime I called her office to find out why they had sent me there..the girl told me they had a list of names the dr used but that my insurance didn't cover them so she just looked one up. Are you serious?? When I asked to speak to dr jacobs they told me I has to make another appt. Then the bill came and there were things I'd been charged for that I never hsd done..I spend months w their billing dept trying to get it fixed. ..it was an endless loop. I called tge dr....wrote her..she never responded and then they wouldn't give me an appt unless I paid the bill first which I refused because it was wrong. So they held all the test results too...wouldn't tell me anything. I would never go there or recommend it. The only reason I'm reviewing it now is yelp wasn't around then and a friend recently asked me about her...it drudge up my experience there. Hopefully they improved but by the current reviews. It doesn't sound like it. Btw becauae of the screw up w the specialist I was unable to get the mri as my insurance ended that Dec and it was then considered a prior .\n",

It is extremely difficult to speak with a live person, you mostly deal with voicemail and it takes forever to get a response. My father who can barely walk needed a handicapped hang tag. I personally gave the office the paper work and it never was followed up on. My mother needed placement in to an alzheimer facility and we needed papers signed by the Dr. ASAP so we could move her in. The home would not let her in with out it being signed. The papers were faxed and no response. I finally got hold of a person on the phone and explained the urgency because the space was being held and it was a safety issue, and I needed the papers signed by Thursday. It gave them a week. I got a message that the papers would be signed the following Monday. 4 Days late, which made it almost 2 weeks!!!!! If I lived closer I would have personally showed up in that office and pulled the records of my parents to take them to a more caring efficient office!!!! I have zero problems with the Dr himself, it is the office management ultimately to blame. The doctor probably had no idea this was going on!\n",

      "       I've been going to Dr. Leslie Jacobs for the past 4 years. When you walk in, the building is an older building and its packed with people. You think to yourself its like any other HMO/PPO doctor's office. However, I like the way that Dr. Jacobs operates. She performs many tests when you first see her, that way there's a baseline for anything that may come up. I know that many people think that they do too many tests, but with a strong family history of breast cancer I feel more comfortable knowing what should be normal and what isn't normal. Overall, she does take the time to listen to what you have concerns about and that is what is most important for me.\n",

      "       My son was in braces for three years with another orthodontist before we went to see Dr. Pearson. His braces had been removed and within six months his bite was open and all his lower teeth had shifted. I was working in the dental field at the time, and when I asked every other dentist or specialist I came in contact with for a recommendation for an orthodontist who would take their time and get my son's teeth right, Dr. Pearson was mentioned every time ! After our initial consult, I knew I was in the right place. Dr. Pearson took his time and treated my son's teeth like they were his own and his staff is INCREDIBLE -- always pleasant and efficient. Dr. Pearson is intelligent and personable. I wouldn't go anywhere else!\n",

      "       We should have visited other orthodontists for my eldest son prior to obtaining services from Pearson. He is rude, condescending, and clearly has a chip on his shoulder. He makes assumptions about patients and their families without a second thought. My eldest did finish his treatment with Pearson and his teeth looks fine. However at the initial appointment we were told about the different procedures that my son would need, however most were not conducted. Which makes me wonder if we were charged for them or not. At this point I rather just leave everything the way if is so that I never have to deal with guy again. My son needed a replacement retainer which we procured at our family dentist. We have taken my younger son to a different orthodontist and have been so pleasantly surprised at the differences in treatment, respect, and cost.\n",

Dr. Pearson and his team use SureSmile wires to ensure that each individual receives the best and fastest treatment possible. Although I just got my braces off, I will continue to visit for check-ups and tracking of my progress with my retainer. Dr. Pearson and his staff are extremely friendly and the office is very welcoming. Dr. Pearson also puts on several events a year for his patients and their families. No matter where you are coming from the office is conveniently located. Being an adult with braces, I am extremely interested in all the details and plans that Dr. Pearson had for my treatment.

This is a great little spot located in Tempe, I go to university so it's super convenient for me, and from what I know the owner has been around for many years which is always comforting in a business! It's a very relaxed atmosphere inside and I like that it doesn't feel like a gross retail chain like European Wax Center or something. Most of my experiences here are usually excellent and I can always count on them getting me in for an appointment if I need to be waxed. All of my Brazilians that I've had done here are practically painless and some of the best experiences I've ever had. The reason for only 4 stars is because I've had a few estheticians who weren't great but that was about their personal technique and how they waxed me- this place overall is great.\n",

      "       First, let me start by thanking the Yelpers of Tempe for writing honest, great reviews. My next thanks goes to Judy's, for being awesome! My search for new places always begins with Yelp. And after reading numerous reviews about Judy's, I decided this was the place to go. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I've been going here for a couple years now, and each time is very pleasant. I've gotten both eyebrow and upper lip waxes here. I've been seen by Jill, Angel, Pamela, and Brooke; they are all very lovely ladies who do an amazing job. They are very sweet, friendly, personable, down to Earth gals. I could go on with a long list of why they're great, but I'll spare you the time because I think you get the point. If you're hesitant about trusting someone else with your brows (or your lady 'stache), these ladies won't let you down. I'd recommend them to anyone and everyone. If you have sensitive skin, I would suggest letting them know beforehand or scheduling with Pamela. I am the least red afterwards when I see her. I think it might have something to do with the temperature she keeps her wax, but whatever it may be, it works! Thank you ladies!\n",

      "       I really needed my brows waxed since we're going on vacation in a few days; gotta get those things tamed! I always get really nervous with new people waxing my eye brows. Too many times I've left a place with odd shaped brows or half of one missing. Ugh so frustrating... Based on all the great yelp reviews I called Judy's and made an appointment and I'm sooo glad I did! Pamela did an excellent job, she's an experienced professional. She was friendly, made me feel comfortable but was also quick. After the appointment the woman at the front desk gave me a pamphlet of their other services so I plan on checking out the facials and the acupuncture. Also, don't let the outside of the building fool you. It's an older building for sure but they definitely put love into the inside with updated furniture, new paint and brightly colored art on the walls. I love that it smells like essential oils too (I'm an aromatherapist, lol). I'll definitely be back and would highly recommend this business!\n",

      "       After seeing the same person for seven years to maintain what little eyebrows I have left, I was hesitant to embark on a goldilocks-and-the-three-bears journey of finding an aesthetician who could rip the tiny hairs from my face in the loving and gentle way that only an aesthetician could do. If you've had a bad experience with waxing and are looking for an aesthetician that you can trust, Judy's is worth a drive out of the way. I've been coming here on and off for a few months and have seen Pamela every time. She's great-quick on the wax and really takes the time to shape, which is particularly tough with my paper thin eyebrows. It's best to call in for an appointment, but they do take walk-ins. I've called as late as the day of on a Saturday and was still able to get in, something I was never able to do at my old salon. The receptionist is nice and the office is very...zen? Waxing services are crazy cheap (at least in my experience) and given that this is a local place, I'd recommend it over any nail salon or chain in the area.\n",

      "       Best eyebrow waxing I have ever gotten! I've searched high and low for a great place to get my eyebrows done. Judy's is by far the best and most welcoming service I have ever received. An eyebrow waxing only costs $15, which is right about on par with many of the nail salons that offer waxing services. However, unlike many of the nail salons, the technicians are only offering waxing services. There is never any rush, yet the appointments are quick while thorough. My appointments typically last about ten minutes, depending on how long it has been since my previous one. They shape your eyebrows to your face, rather than whatever the preference of whoever is doing the waxing. While I get my eyebrows done by Jill (who is amazing!) I have no doubt that everyone else is superb as well. As if everything else weren't enough, in less than six months I've noticed my hair go from incredibly thick to fine and rather unnoticeable to others. In fact, when I went in for my regular three week appointment today, Jill initially commented on how my brows weren't ready for a waxing. It wasn't until she started actually waxing that she noticed just how fine the hair had gotten. As long as I am in the Tempe/Phoenix area I'll be going to Judy's. You really can't beat it.\n",

She is very sweet, very experience, and very attentive to me and my hairs! Plus she was able to tell me a little bit about the electrolysis hair removal treatments that Judy offers.

She's cocky and should be!!! She was able to do what no one else has been able to do since I left Chicago. This woman knows her waxing ways! The best! Carrie gave me the best massage of my life. She literally put me to sleep by her magical hands. Oh, and her prices are extremely fair. She also gives pregnancy massages. A+ I love this place. Wish I could give more stars!!!\n",

      "       I've been going here for at least five years, having been referred by friends who have been going here for years. I see Dr. Jen for chiropractic and also have had waxing and body work done. Although it might seem weird to have chiropractic and waxing in the same place, Dr. Jen and Judy are cousins who always wanted to work together. Voila--Judy's body waxing and harmonic healing center. Don't worry--just because they do waxing and massage, the chiropractic care is top notch and the fact that they share space shouldn't give you any pause about going there. And don't worry--if you go there for chiro, your receipt won't say anything about waxing, so your insurance won't freak out. :-) Dr. Jen is awesome--just make sure to call early for an appointment because she can get pretty booked up. (because she's that awesome). I've even taken my kids to her and she's great with them too. The front office staff is also aweome (especially Kyra) who is friendly and very efficient. The vibe is very relaxing and I don't know that I've ever waited more than five minutes beyond my appointment time for mine to get started. (either for waxing or chiropractic). Bottom line--I highy recommend them!\n",

      "       My review reflects my experience in November of 2010. I've debated about writing a review for the last 7.5 years, but I believe my case is an isolated case and unique. Dr Castilla is very attentive and caring. That's what I adored about her. When I became pregnant with my first daughter in 2007 and at about 4 -6 months into my pregnancy, I switched from obstetrics to midwifery. It wasn't because of Dr Castilla, it was just a personal preference. I spoke to her about this and she encouraged my decision. The conversation was very heartfelt and honest and I never regretted having my first child with a midwife and at home. After the delivery, I still sought Dr Castilla out for gynecological care. In 2010 I became pregnant with my second daughter. Returned to my midwife to be in her care and to deliver at home once again. I delivered at home, but after the delivery, I was hospitalized. I will leave out the details for the reason of my hospitalization. After 3 days at Scottsdale/Shea, I was released home with a catheter and was advise to see my ob/gyn. I went in to see Dr Castilla. The first this she said when she walked into the examining room was \"What were you thinking to have a home birth?\". I was in tears. Up to that point, there was encouragement and support. I did not fault her for my ending up in the hospital. I needed her care after and I did not receive it. Instead, I was demeaned for making a choice that was initially supported. After that appointment, I had made the decision to leave her care. It was extremely sad, because she had been my physician since 2001. I understand, my case was an extreme example and not many physicians support midwifery, but I needed her care and not her harsh criticism. She's an amazing doctor and she really does care for her patients. If you are the typical patient, you will find no fault in her abilities and practices. If you are someone like me, who needed her care, you maybe a bit disappointed.\n",

      "       There is no doubt Dr. Castilla is as good as it gets, and not just as an obstetrician. She has been my Doctor since beginning 2002, she delivered my last of 8 children. She also discovered and believed the possibility of me having appendicitis when I was six months pregnant. The hospital sent me home, my husband carried me into her office, she sent me immediately back, said yes the pain could be in a totally different area then the hospital said it had to be in, and she called in a surgical consult. They did an emergency exploratory surgery and found it right at the bursting point. When the anesthesiologist punctured my spine during the epidural, she was the only one who listened, I called his office, he denied it, and again, I went back to Dr. Castilla who was out of town, but the office sent me immediately to ER, they gave me a spinal blood patch to fix the issue after being there a few days. And lastly, when my gall bladder went bad, my endocrinologist ignored it, said it was a 'muscular pain' and next visit, so did her nurse practitioner. I was in pain so I went over to Dr. Castilla's office, and she saw me, and LISTENED. See that is the difference, I've had 4 different OB/GYN's based on where I lived, but Dr. Castilla listens, and she makes the right diagnosis. She sent me for a ultrasound, and I had tons of stones, hernia and bad gall bladder. She got me a surgical consult right away, and shortly thereafter I was operated on. Had it not been for Dr. Castilla truthfully, I do not know if my last child would have survived. The surgeon said if the appendix had burst when I was 7 mos. pregnant, that it would have been bad. Highly recommend.\n",

      "       Dr. Castilla was my OB/GYN in 2013 when I was pregnant with my first child. I loved how easy it was to schedule appointments and how easy going she was. I was terrified but she made everything seem like a piece of cake. Delivery day was good too and she was there when I needed her. She put all the pieces together better than it was before. ..if you know what I mean ;) Thank you for taking care of me and my child.\n",

She guided me through my pregnancy beautifully and ended up inducing me early because of a complication. She monitored my baby's growth very carefully throughout my pregnancy and for that I am eternally grateful. I hate to think what would have happened if I didn't have Dr. Castilla's expertise and care. She makes you feel very comfortable and I feel like I can talk to her about anything. I will continue to go to Dr. Castilla and I hope to have her as my OB for my next pregnancy. I drive from Gilbert to her office in north Scottsdale for her because she is worth it!\n",

      "       Dr's here are terrific if you ever can get an appointment to see one. Office is beautiful inside. But they probably should have invested the $$ in upgrading the office functionality. Phone system in not user friendly..all robots and slim chance of getting human to ever answer phone. Then she redirects u 2 voicemail even if it's within operational hours. U better be dying, hemorrhaging or in labor right now they just transfer u back into the voicemail system. Posted hours do not reflect actual hours of operation. Need yr records sent to you or another Dr? Great! This office is trapped in the 80's and not technology friendly. To convey information and records the use fax, snail mail, and probably last owners of a typewriter. Unfortunately, making their turn around time REALLY slow. Online.. What's that? The whole office doesn't even have one email address. Great Dr's if u ever get an appointment. 2 month waiting period average.\n",

Belinda was very knowledgeable in answering any questions I had and I am convinced that if you are looking for quality care, you should come to their office. Thank you so much for your help. Round two was today, May 15th,2018. Again I was treated very well and even my copay went down! These people have done such a good job I would like to recommended Katsur to anyone needing dental work. Thanks again you guys Part 3 was today and I am very impressed with my crowns. If you want quality care at a reasonable price, head on over to Katsur you won't be sorry.\n",

      "       New to Peoria and needed a dentist. The insurance company gave us this name and number. Called and made an appointment. I should have known then when I had given the lady all the insurance information and she had to call back that something was off. Went in and the office has no appeal but the receptionist (blond hair, no makeup,unsmiling, resting bitch face) was the rudest person I have met in a long time. The front office is the first person a person sees and that person sets the tone of the appointment, she needs to learn a few in customer service and friendliness. I wanted to walk out and take the girls with me but we followed it through. Teenage daughters get called back and it took one daughter 1 hour 48 minutes for a cleaning. She just walks back out and I am asking her whats going on, does she have cavities, what took so long, everything ok and so forth, she said it was good and they didn't tell her anything. The other daughter a lady walked out and had me sign paperwork, standing in a hall on my knee?! The girls both need their wisdom teeth out the and dental office gave bad referrals. I asked the girls, well what did you think and their opinion was 25/75 on overall. The dentist was good/funny but the rest of the staff was rude and moody. This would be a successful office if their staff was classier and friendlier. What made it so unpleasant, I waited to ask to use the bathroom or where the bathroom was and the front office girl had the phone on her shoulder, listening to hold music and had me standing there waiting for 5 minutes. I waited, then when she was clearly finished I asked for a bathroom she was so rude that my daughter was shocked. I found it funny and of course chuckled but what are you going to say or do?! Last but not least, who wants different dentist for their kids or family? My son has an appointment and the girl (Faith) (must be same girl) was just as rude on the phone. To the point I had to tell her to stop and listen, he has a different insurance so it is different information. She clearly could care less. I was also in the middle of asking her to send a new referral over to the oral surgery but she hung up. I called back for over an hour but no one answered. I called the Goodyear office and Ashley answered and it was seriously night and day. Ashley was so helpful and listened and assisted the correct way. So the 1 star goes to Ashley at the Goodyear office! Thank you!

      "       I have been going to Katsur Dental for the past 10 years ever since I moved here from Massachusetts. All of my visits have been very positive. My hygienist is very professional and does a great job with my cleanings and explaining any issues to me. Recently I have had to have a crown replaced and Dr. Turner took care of it with minimum discomfort. My sister, a snowbird, has been going there for her cleanings and xrays for the past couple of years and my adult daughter also went for her cleanings when she stayed with me for 2 years, both at a much reduced cost than they would have paid back East. My grandson goes to Katsur for orthodontics and cleanings. I would highly recommend Katsur Dental!\n",

They were so nice and was able to get me in. I ended up being late and they said to still come in. I was taken back and felt very comfortable. The dr came in took a look and was very upfront and honest about what was going on. The dr was very nice and even joked around which made me feel more at ease. I would highly recommend them.\n",

      "       I can't count on one hand how many dentists I have had in my life. I have only had one good one many years ago in Calif. When he passed away, that was the end of good for many many years. From that point on, I have had some pretty shoddy work done and had to find other dentists to fix the work of the one before them and so on and so on and so on....... It was my belief that there weren't any good dentists in AZ. period, until, I went to Katsur Dental. Prior to going to Katsur, I had gone to another dentist to get an estimate on fixing someone else's shoddy work. They wanted to charge me what it would cost for the original work. All I needed was a fix not a complete overhaul. Thought I would try Katsur to see what they wanted for the fix job. Really wasn't expecting much, but much to my surprise, I not only got a fix job, but an AWESOME fix job, for HALF the price I was quoted from the previous dentist. I really loved Dr. Reese Turnre's attitude of; \"If it aint broke don't try to fix it\"! A man after my own heart. He is extremely professional in a very casual way which is cool. His staff is awesome, pricing is more than fair, he doesn't try to sell you anything you DON'T need, and most of all, he listens to your input and opinions and truly cares about you and your issues. I have been going to Katsur for about two years now. It's good quality work at fair pricing and they take responsibility and accountability for any unforeseen issues that may arise. This is a big plus in my book! I guess the bottom line is; after searching for the ideal Dentist and one I can trust for 53 years, I found him at Katsur Dental.\n",

      "       My husband came here for his tooth that was causing him some pain. Our last dentist really gave us the run around and my husband was a little put off about seeing another dentist. So this dentist really had his hands full with him. My husband said he was very nice and has good humor. He is very friendly with his staff and treats them with respect and kindness as if they are his family. My husband ended up needing a root canal and was scheduled the following week. The dentist gave him a script for pain meds, antibiotics, and an anxity med to call him down before the procedure. This was very nice of him. During the root canal the doctor acknowledged that my husband is a red head and per past studies tend to need more anesthesia then other people. This was very nice because he does have a low pain tolerance. After he got into my husbands mouth and started to work he realized more needed to be down. He did not charge up for the little extra work which I was felt was very generous of him. To this dentist it was more about care then pinching us for all our money. Just for the record had we been asked to pay we would have but that is not what this was about. He does not push extra services on you that you do not need. If you come in for a root canal you will get a root canal not pressured to get a platinum grill.\n",

      "       I can only say, merci! Merci! Merci! Thank you! Thank you. Miracle shoe insoles. Amazing comfort in shoes. 1st the insoles: - From almost tears of pain and giving up on all my shoes, to instant! INSTANT! Relief. Sounds too good to be true? Believe what you want. My foot pain has practically disappeared. I'm sure some foot healing is required, but I expect painless walking and standing in the next days. 2nd Shoes: I have to say one very subjective and personal observation. Having been an Italian style shoe wearer, I can say these shoes are BUTT ugly! Period. In my eyes. However, the comfort I am experiencing, is nothing short of miraculous. I just don't look down. Price, ugly and comfortable. 3rd and most important - The care with which I was attended to was second to none. Knowledgeable, caring and not on a sales treadmill. Thank you! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n",

      "       Que dire de mon passage dans ce chaleureux centre, entiÃ¨rement dÃ©diÃ© au bien-Ãªtre au naturel? Une boutique oÃ¹ l'on vient s'asseoir sur chaises et fauteuils ergonomiques pour se rÃ©chauffer au poÃªle Ã  bois, et jaser pendant des heures avec un personnel hyper gÃ©nÃ©reux souhaitant partager le plus d'informations possibles Ã  propos des techniques de santÃ© alternatives? Je fus surpris d'apprendre, entre mille et une choses pertinentes, que je me retrouvais dans l'une des plus vieilles communes montrÃ©alaises. Au premier abord, l'on pourrait croire qu'il ne s'agit que d'un simple magasin de chaussures, mais ce serait le sous-estimer que de ne pas en dire davantage... En tout cas, je dois absolument y retourner pour acheter une paire de sandales Ã©laborÃ©e selon des principes orthopÃ©diques allemands trÃ¨s innovateurs. Ce sont les produits Birkenstock que vous retrouverez ici. C'est que j'ai appris que 95% des problÃ¨mes dorsaux sont directement reliÃ©s aux pieds... Le lit du pied des chaussures et sandales (en liÃ¨ge et rÃ©sine) est totalement inspirÃ© de l'empreinte que laisse le pied humain dans le sable. Ãa me coÃ»terait environ 140$ pour une paire, sauf que les semelles sont garanties et remplacÃ©es Ã  la boutique une fois usÃ©es... C'est pour ainsi dire des chaussures Ã  vie... Il est aussi possible d'y apporter son eau afin de la distiller dans leur propre distillateur. L'on donne ce que l'on veut en Ã©change; il s'agit d'une contribution volontaire. Le responsable m'a montrÃ© la derniÃ¨re rÃ©colte de sÃ©diments rejetÃ©s Ã  la suite de l'opÃ©ration, minÃ©raux que nos reins s'efforcent normalement de filtrer lorsque nous buvons de l'eau du robinet. Je n'en revenais pas!... J'ai aussi essayÃ© leur hamac et chaises suspendues faits en toile de chanvre (trÃ¨s solides et rÃ©sistent aux dÃ©gradations des intempÃ©ries). Un livre trÃ¨s mystÃ©rieux, Ã©crit par Louis Kuhne, naturopathe allemand qui centra ses approches mÃ©dicales de dÃ©sintoxications corporelles sur les transferts d'Ã©nergie thermique, m'a beaucoup intriguÃ©... Enfin, des cours de yoga aquatique (dans une piscine en location) sont offerts. Le but Ã©tant de proposer des nouvelles faÃ§ons de Â«pÃ©nÃ©trerÂ» l'eau, plus harmonieuses et fluides, ce qui redÃ©finirait le relation du vivant avec l'environnement marin (Ã©cologie, sensibilisation, conscientisation, etc).\n",

      "       I have had sooo many horrible dental experiences that when my husband and I switched to Dr. Lebowitz and staff, I was skeptical. We have been going to Dr. Lebowitz for several years now and I can confidently say, he has earned or won over my complete trust. He is up to date on the newest technology and my visits there are without incidence. He has had to re-do alot of bad work, but I relax (as well as I can) in the knowledge that I have finally found the best! I love the office staff, especially my hygienist Debbie. Love, love, love them all!!!\n",

      "       I had blood work done on Wednesday and the nurse called me Thursday night at 7PM with the results. I missed the phone call because I didn't expect a call that late. I had called the office five times that day left three messages waiting for the results. The nurse left a message and says to call her back so I did and it says the office is closed. I called her not five minutes after she left the message. Why not leave a direct phone number so I can reach you right away if you're still there? So I called the office Friday morning. The office is CLOSED on Fridays!! You cannot get ahold of any nurses or doctors during that time. So I have to wait all weekend for my results. So here it is Monday and I called the nurse back and I got her voicemail once again I left a message and I'm waiting for these results that I need ASAP. Dr. Sauter and Dr. Leon are amazing doctors. Dr. Leon delivered my son. But the front house staff is incompetent. You have to be really pushy to get taken care of here. I had two miscarriages before this pregnancy so I have to be really pushy to get my blood work to make sure all my levels are OK and I'm not going to miscarry again. Also I need to know my levels to see if they're going to put me on any hormone treatment like last time. And those treatments need to be done with in the first trimester. I am 41 years old with two miscarriages and the staff had the guts to tell me that I'm overreacting in wanting immediate care! I wanted an ultrasound and blood work done ASAP. Also if you're pregnant and you make an appointment to see the doctor you don't see the doctor right away. You see the nurse practitioner for the first two appointments then around your second trimester you see the doctor. I've never been to an OB/GYN's office where you don't see the doctor in the first appointment! I'm not sure if this is just Vegas and this is how they do things here but I've never received such lack of care and concern for their patients. When I could not get ahold of anyone last week after the nurse left me a message I called high-risk pregnancy doctors office and I have an appointment next week and I will see the doctor on my first appointment and have an ultrasound done plus bloodwork ASAP. I cannot go through another pregnancy dealing with the stress and headaches this front office gives me. That's too bad because the doctors are awesome. I do like the phlebotomist she is in house and doesn't amazing job and the ultrasound tech is also in house and does an amazing job. If you can get past the front desk and be pushy in receiving care then you'll be OK. Also the billing department messed up a couple of times so make sure they are billing you correctly.\n",

      "       I've been going here for 5 years now. The office staff is very friendly and accommodating, often able to get me same day appointments when needed. They are up front about billing and inform me of any copays from the start. Office visits are usually prompt and I rarely wait more than 15 minutes for appointments. When I became pregnant I started seeing Dr. Sauter. I was pleasantly surprised when he supported my desire for an all natural delivery. Appointments can be short and sweet if everything is normal. If you do come prepared with questions he always takes the time to answer all your questions. I never felt rushed. When I was in labor at the hospital I was worried Dr. Sauter would not return for my delivery as he was there just 3 hours earlier. However, when it was my turn Dr Sauter returned and he was a great coach throughout the entire pushing process. My husband even commented how impressed he was with Dr Sauter during the delivery process. I recommend legacy women's health and Dr Sauter to any women looking for quality care.\n",

      "       Let's face it - nobody really likes going to the dentist but Loving Family Dental makes it as pleasurable as it's possible to be. My wife and I have been patients since we moved to Arizona and we become more delighted with Loving every visit. My latest visit just yesterday showed how good and honest they are. I chipped a front tooth while on vacation and managed to get an emergency appointment on the first morning I was back. Frankly I was skeptical that it could be repaired without being obvious plus that it would cost an arm and a leg. Boy was I wrong on both counts. Dr. Tim Loving recommended just bonding where the tooth was chipped which would only take fifteen minutes, and told me that this was the best way and most economical way to do it rather than capping the whole tooth which would cost a heck of a lot more and take much longer. When he handed me a mirror I was shocked as you cannot tell where it was chipped at all. There was no pain whatsoever even when I got the bill. I have the utmost confidence in them. They have lovely premises and all the staff are wonderful.\n",

      "       I've been coming here for over a year. Today was my 3rd visit. As per usual, I'm extremely satisfied with things overall. Not only with the results but also with the staff. As a male, it was never fully comfortable going to get spa treatments, facials or injectables. Maybe it's just the antiquated stigma that \"this stuff is for women\". Still, Matt made me feel welcomed and at ease. He's very professional and very knowledgeable. Now to what happened today on my visit. You see, I found this place through Groupon and though I seldom use Groupon, they had a good deal on Dysport. Unknowingly though, I used the allotted amount of Groupon's available for this product. Today, upon my 3rd visit, I was advised that I had reached my limit and that it was not their policy to accept Groupons after customers had reached their limit. I was told this by the owner, Matt. Still, he told me that he didn't want to put me through the hassle of getting a refund through Groupon and would allow me to use it. Let me be clear; he didn't have to honor it. He could have rejected the Groupon and told me I'd have to pay for it by other means. The simple fact that he accepted it was very kind of him and a great display of customer service. Upon further research, I confirmed that businesses do in fact lose a chunk of money when they offer products through Groupon. So again, I'm sure my repeated use of them doesn't help their business. So I think that shows what kind of business Matt runs. One where he cares about his customers and will sometimes take a loss to make sure a customer leaves happy and satisfied. That is why I will continue coming here. The results have always been great and they last me about 4-5 months on average. Matt says that he'll match prices with competitors in the area but his prices are already good to begin with so there's no need to look elsewhere.\n",

      "       SECOND REVIEW! I'm leaving another review after I talked with Matt last week. Both my mother &amp; myself have sent him about 7-10 new clients (where referrals are supposed to get you discounts and such, just like most places) and Matt refused to acknowledge we ever sent anyone to him. Within 1.5 months of having my lips filled, they were back to normal. By Dysport in my forehead lasted about 2 months. I was told that each should last roughly 6 months. After knowing what I know now, I feel like his product was watered down. He never drew the product up in front of us of opened packages in front of us - everything was done outside the room. But, back to his sordid unprofessional nature. I was hoping since I had referred several people and the results did not last as promoted, we could work out a good price to re-do these, but he was going to charge me the exact same price that his current Groupon was going for (which I could've just bought on Groupon with a 20% coupon and also caused him to lose some of the profit because Groupon takes a considerable chunk of that money). He then began to guilt me for even asking about how his referral system works (which, he DEFINITELY has one and I've promoted for him like crazy) and why I would be given the same price as the Groupon...he said \"well I have a family and I have to take care of myself too.\" Yes, I get that. But customer satisfaction, your work ethic, and your \"loyalty/referral program\" should kick in somewhere. He thought he was being generous by offering me a generic Groupon price. He left a very sour taste in my mouth and I no longer recommend him (neither does my mother - her results did not last much longer than mine), to anyone. I feel like his product may be watered down. If he is trying to make his clients feel good, he was doing a piss poor job at that. Oh, AND I have been his waitress before after my injections and he was a little tipsy, but said \"oh you're the girl who said all the nice things on Facebook and sent me some new people! Next time you come in you're getting a GREAT deal because you were one of my first clients there and your reviews have helped me so much.\" So again, he knew I had sent him people while I was serving him, but denied it when I called to make some sort of appointment to correct the lack of results I was promised. He's just not a man of his word and that's just sad. He did a good job when it was 1st done, but the results did not last and he is not professional. I guess that's why he has had to have a Groupon special running for over a year, he can't get repeat clients.\n",

      "       What a horrible experience. I scheduled a 60-minute facial and spoke directly to Matt when I scheduled. He seemed nice at the time. I called a few hours before my appt. because the weather was really rough outside and I was not sure if they would stay open and/or I would have trouble on the roads. I spoke with Matt again and he had a bit of an attitude. I brushed it off thinking maybe others are calling with the same issue. I arrived 10 minutes early for my appt. and when it was 10 minutes after my appt. time, I asked the receptionist what the delay was and she said it should only be a few more minutes. I asked where Matt was and she said he was gone for the day. She could tell I was a bit put off having to wait past my scheduled time. Well....the esthetician was 30 minutes behind which really put me in a bind because I had to get to work (which I ended up being late for). The facial experience itself was horrible. First - the room is very, very small and the table is 3' high. I am on the shorter side and had to get a chair to use to get onto the bed. There was no dimmer in the room so the light overhead was very bright. The esthetician mentioned she had only been working there four weeks and she asked for a lamp but never got one. She proceeds with the facial and after a bit of cleansing she applied an \"acid\" mask. I have never heard of such a thing and it literally felt like my face was on fire. The burn was unbearable and I did my best to stay calm and ask for it to be removed from my face. It took about 20 minutes for my face to cool off (she did apply an oatmeal mask afterwards that was a little gentler). Parts of my face the following morning were actually pealing. I've been getting facials for over ten years and never had such a horrific experience. When I went to check out I wanted to use a credit card for the tip. The receptionist said she had to charge money ($.01) first before she could ring it up. I found that to be odd since a lot of merchants these days' use square or something of the like and it never charges you a small amount before you can process the actual charge. While reviews are certainly subjective, I cannot sugar coat this one. It is what it is and my experience was a bit of a nightmare. Live and Learn!\n",

      "       Firstly Massage Heights will attempt to sell you a membership. Basically it entails committing to one 60 min massage month for about $80, with additional add ons such as hot stone, at discounted prices of which they automatically withdraw from you every month. Now I know other reviewers are put off by the sales pitch at the end, however, I was just very polite and up front that I was not interested in a membership. Now that you know it's a membership facility, you can decide for yourself it's worth your while. If you go for regular massages (twice a month) as well as your benefits has a high max, then it may be worth your while. The massage room I was in was very nice, neat and tidy. The room had a very relaxed and serene feel to it, as you would want it to be for any massage. Linens were also top quality. My masseuse Darrell was excellent. So Massage Heights does have something to offer. Honestly, I believe if they scrap this whole \"membership\" gimmick, and just charge $80-90 per massage, they can still retain a set clientele if not get even more traffic. My regular masseuse charges $90 and i don't have to sign a contract or do any pre-authorized payments. I'm loyal to her both for her massage technique and price. I only booked an appointment here because my work is switching benefit providers and I needed to use up my massage benefit and my regular masseuse was all booked up. I would have rated Massage Heights Northgate location 5 stars if not for the membership gimmick. The masseuse and facilities were great! I highly recommend they re-think their business model. I probably will not return only because I don't want to pay the \"non-member\" price for their services and I'm not willing to commit to a \"membership.\" Their introductory prices is very good though, so if you're willing to go through the uncomfortable sales pitch, it's $60 for a 1 hr massage if you're a first timer.\n",

      "       DO NOT JOIN MASSAGE HEIGHTS CROWFOOT! The first thing you need to know about Massage Heights is that they keep their prices cheap by ONLY hiring inexperienced massage therapists. How do I know this? A chatty therapist told all one session. She let me know that Massage Heights hires Massage Therapy students and new grads that they can pay cheaply since they're just trying to get experience. I asked if any experienced people stay there and she said no, they would go to better places like clinics or upscale spas. That said, the quality of massages is good...but getting in is the challenge. Sunlike recently changed their policy (unfortunately, after I already signed a one year contract) so that Massage Therapists have to have something like 2000 hours of experience to be covered. The majority of therapists at Massage Heights are, as I said, inexperienced so expect to be booking months in advance if you work regular business hours and have other commitments to work around. I can tolerate booking in advance, but what I cannot tolerate is that my appointments are continually cancelled by them and often when my appointment is not cancelled it is a different date and time from what I had scheduled. Trying to deal with the receptionists is difficult and the manager is equally as difficult. They would rather lose customers than make things right with them at their cost. In brief, don't commit! If you need a quick and cheap one time massage then sure, but don't lock yourself in with this place.\n",

      "       I recently injured my back at work and have previously found massage helpful. I called to book my appointment, and asked if the massage would be covered under my insurance, the receptionist was quick to say yes that I would be covered. When I arrived I told the receptionist that I was with sunlife and asked if they did direct billing, she told me it was easy and I could do it online myself. My massage therapist was Neil, he was great. When I left the receptionist said it should only take about 48 hours to get my money back from insurance. I sent my information online to sunlife, and was surprised to see that the claim was denied. I proceeded to call sunlife who informed me Neil didn't have 2200 hours. I called massage heights, the receptionist told me this has never happened before and the manager wasn't in but she would call me back the next day. A few days went by and there was no phone call. After calling back the manager wasn't in again. Finally later that day Aleia called me back to inform me Neil didn't have the 2200 hours, and passed the blame onto the insurance company. I would have NEVER got the massage if I knew it wasn't going to be covered. They were so shady and I would never go back here again.VERY DISAPPOINTED!\n",

      "       A couple weeks ago, I was in need of a massage. The places I usually go to were booked so I called around and found Massage Heights over in the NE across from Marlborough Mall. When I arrived, I was greeted and asked to fill out the standard forms for first time customers. In a few minutes, my massage therapist, Carmen, came out. She seemed nice and after reading my forms, asked a few questions, then left so I could get ready for my massage. The room was rather chilly and the massage table didn't have any sort of heat pads or anything like that. Guess I'm a bit of a princess because I do expect those things. Who wants to be shivering when trying to enjoy a relaxing massage? The music, however, was really nice and soothing. I told Carmen that I wanted a full body massage, but to focus on my arms and legs, and NOT my back. She started working on my back, of course, with good pressure though. I don't like those really deep massages that usually put me in traction. She got out the knots I had in my upper back. You know the kind you get from sitting at a desk using the mouse too much. Then she massaged my neck and shoulders and the next day, I totally hurt. I've never experienced such pain after a massage as I did from here. Carmen spent a little bit of time on my legs but certainly not enough. Then I flip over and she massages my legs a bit more. Then my neck and head. And boom, she proclaims our time is up. What? Did she completely forget that I mentioned to focus on my legs and ARM? Apparently so. That really frustrated me. Not the kind of feeling I want after an hour long massage. After getting dressed, I headed out front to pay. They had some kind of introductory special for new clients. Great I'm thinking. Not so fast. The girl behind the counter asks me if my benefit provider happens to be Sun Life or Manulife. I say yes, I'm with Sun Life. She says that they have stopped reimbursing people for any massage therapist who doesn't have at least 2000 hours. I notice a paper taped to the desk, off to the right of where I'm standing. It explains this. And guess what? Carmen only has a lousy 900 hours. Great I'm fucked now for sure. You think it couldn't get any worse. But it does. The girl tries to \"sell\" me their member ship. Like I want to hear a sales pitch after a crappy massage and being $60 out of my own pocket? I think not. The girl blabs on about how she will wave the membership fee and that I can have a monthly massage for some set price, blah blah blah. I've tuned out. All I can think about is that they should have mentioned this whole thing about the insurance benefits. My blood pressure continues to rise. I'm no longer relaxed. What a waste of money this was. The next day I call and talk to the manager. She sounded like she was about 14 yrs old. Young and inexperienced and a lack of customer service. Yes blame the customer. She kept saying that we try to tell people and we have this sign. Oh yeah, tape the sign down to the counter off to the side where you don't see it. Brilliant idea! She says Oh if you have any suggestions for me on how we could improve, I would gladly take them into consideration. I've already mentioned having a sign that's noticeable and perhaps having the receptionist mention this whole thing. Oh wait, we're dealing with 20 year olds who don't know shit about anything so I shouldn't expect them to actually think about something that might benefit the client. She blabs some more about trying to improve things but still doesn't seem to hear what I'm saying. She said I could try to submit my claim to Sun Life and see if they will pay it. I've done that and haven't heard back yet. One thing is for sure, I will never go to this place again. I hate dealing with young idiots, not to mention a massage therapist who doesn't listen to me, the client, the one who's paying. I've had my share of massages over the years and this one tops my list of worst experiences. They only care about signing you up for their program. I felt cheap and like they were trying to make me join a gym. Sooooo not what I expected going for a massage. This was the first time I felt more stressed out after a massage than I did before.\n",

I drive halfway across town just to see Dr. Mitchell, and it would not hurt for her to be nicer. Aside from that, Dr. Mitchell is a great doctor whom you can trust.\n",

      "       There are so many choices when it comes to Plastic surgeons however its slim picking when it comes to finding a surgeon who isn't a money hungry over injector. I have been seeing Dr Mitchell for over 3 years now and he helps me age gracefully with preventative maintenance. If I don't need something that I want him to inject, he tells me no way and explains why I don't need it. I never want to look like a duck billed platypus or get that older cat faced look, he injects with precision where you need it and will NEVER over do it. He's definitely an artist and there is no one else that I would trust with my facial fillers. He really appreciates &amp; values his clientele. His office staff, namely Laurita is amazing. They are very organized and run a great office. You will not be disappointed with Dr. Mitchell!\n",

I will never get this done again. Warning!!! Do not get a microneedling from them. They did an awful job! It took 5 days to BEGIN to heal. There was so much redness and it was painful. I was getting it done because I thought it would help my acne scars and pores. It ABSOLUTELY made it worse. Even with makeup, it looks awful! Very upset!!! Very DISAPPOINTING results!!! 10 LONG days and it still looks depressing. I'm considering hiring an attorney.\n",

      "       In the world of plastic surgery andaesthetics who you pick may be just as important as what is what you pick. Ryan Mitchel is very honest. He will not try to upscale you. He instead work with the Beauty you already have and enhances it. He is willing to go the extra mile. He keeps his word- and if for some reason what he has told you can no happen- he will make it up to you in other ways. This man is a good soul. It is very important to trust the person creating your look- I trust him. And that is a marvelous feeling. His staff is the cherry on top. They are so easy to talk to- I find myself hanging out with them just to chat. But they really do help ok every way. Every way. I am So happy I found this office - I feel like home when I am there - and trust everyone - can't wait to get back. I like these people. I do.

My eyebrow hasn't ever looked right after getting the injections by 3 different doctors offices. Dr. Mitchell was awesome! He is polite and gentle. The other injections I've had always hurt so I was surprised at how little I felt the treatment when Dr. Mitchell did it.

      "       I am sooooooo happy that I found Dr. Mitchell!!!! I am a month postop and I am LOVING my new boobs all thanks to Dr. Mitchell and staff. I felt like Dr. Mitchell cared about me as a person not just a client. As soon as I met with Dr. Mitchell I knew I wanted him to do my procedure. I felt so comfortable and in great hands. Dr. Mitchell helped me understand everything about what was being done and how everything works. He helped me decide what size and implant was best for my body and shape. I so so happy with everything from my first visit to after surgery. I have been wanting to get this done for a very long time, but have been very scared because I watch Botch and you never know what could happen. As long as you have Dr. Mitchell you will be fine!!!! Do yourself a favor and at least meet with Dr. Mitchell......he is the VERY BESTll!!!! Thank you so much Dr. Mitchell for doing great work!!!!\n",

      "       Amazing experience! I would hv only one recommendation to talk to Lorita when dealing with any front office stuff. (The receptionist Jessica or whatever her name is... Seemed to not get things done) but honestly I am so glad my friend referred me here to Dr. Mitchell. I have 3 children from ages 9 years to 11 months old &amp; will be 28 next week. So it was time for my self to get a breast augmentation. From the initial consult he was spot on with everything I had been wanting. He left me with all my questions answered &amp; was so nice. Lorita is the go to girl for any questions!! I Am a cash pt so for the lab work it was $48 &amp; only $68 for my RX. I Chose saline Mod profile plus 650cc price was $3750 (**I'm sure prices will go up so this was MY Quote, can't promise what it will be for your treatment**) I chose TUBA, through the belly button (he was amazing!!)No scars and this is day 3 and I'm doing great. Will add more post op photos after the healing process. So thankful for Dr. Mitchell &amp; Lorita. They are amazing!\n",

      "       I made an appointment because they were near my place and I liked the fact that they seemed to take a natural, holistic approach. Upon calling I notified them I was self pay. No insurance. The payment process was explained. I thought strange that they wouldn't take cash but no problem. The place is hard to find and parking is very bad. Good thing I wasn't really sick, Cause you have to park in the back alley and walk around the block to get to the entrance. The girl at the front desk was super rude. Told me it would be a while which I expected based on every other doctor visit I've had. Finally got to the room to be examined. I had a very bad dry cough that has been lingering for about 6 weeks. The doctor spent less than 8 minutes with me and was in such a rush, didn't listen or seem to care at all about my symptoms . Prescribed a zpack and rushed out the door. The z pack didnt work and after 2 more weeks I was still sick. They wanted to charge me another outrageous fee for a self pay visit. I had high hopes for this place. Unfortunately I'm still searching for a doctor who listens and cares. Ps- there was someone else's urine sample just sitting in the bathroom when I went to use it.\n",

      "       Dr. G is a phenomenal physician! I love coming to Modern Family Medicine! The ambiance feels homey and fun. It is a little boutique practice and you can tell the staff and the doctor try very hard to take good care of the patients. Immediately, when I walked in, I felt at home. The assistant was busy in the back but there was a sign in sheet. She came out and greeted me. She gave me a patient questionnaire that was very long. It took me 20 minutes to fill it out but made me think about my health and helped me figure out what questions to ask the doctor. I was told that I had a high deductible which meant that I had to pay for the visit. The assistant explained to me that the doctor is very comprehensive and unlike other doctors office, she allows patients to discuss their problems at the wellness visits. My last physician told me I couldn't discuss my hair loss or stress issues at my visit. I didn't quite understand what she was talking about at first but after doing the questionnaire and meeting the doctor, I got it. The doctor spent over 40 minutes with me! I also had my blood drawn the same day! My old doctor made me go to the lab. I really appreciated having a doctor finally take the time to listen and to figure out what type of work up I needed. No one ever did that before! I joined the patient portal and was able to ask the doctor more questions after the visit. Usually doctors are unreachable. Dr. G was great! She sent me messages and gave me some websites to look at. I followed up with her when my tests were back and she figured out my problems. She explained all my labs to me and why she was testing them. I felt like she really listened to me. Both visits cost me a few hundred dollars but that is because I have a crappy insurance plan with a high deductible. They collect the deductible up front and then run it through insurance. I would have had to pay the same amount anywhere I went but I really love Modern Family Medicine and am happy they took me as a patient.\n",

      "       Terrible experience at this doctors office. I wish I could give this place zero stars. I repeated MULTIPLE times during my visit that I only wanted what was included in the wellness visit. They told me that blood work and a urine analysis would be less then $20 to do so I said yes. I was never informed I would be sent a $1300 bill by the lab which was reduced after I provided the lab with my insurance information (the doctors office had not provided it to the lab even though modern medicine had it all). If they would have just informed me that \"the office procedure would be less than $20 but the lab will send you a bill for an unknown amount\" then awesome I can make an informed decision. When they only give me half of the information that is just poor communication skills. Maybe receiving a bill from the lab is common sense to people who go to doctors regularly but I rarely do. Is informing your patients about the cost of procedures THEY are recommending too much to ask? My insurance information was provided to the office but apparently was never actually checked so they recommended things not actually knowing what the cost would come out to be even though I was very persistent about not wanting extra costs. When I called Modern Family Medicine after receiving the horrifying bill Dr. Gartenberg was extremely unprofessional and unhelpful basically saying it was my fault for not memorizing my policy information. The doctor was odd and the feel of the office was odd. Over all this place is a HARD PASS. Save yourself the head ache.\n",

      "       Dr. Gartenberg is an excellent physician! She cares about her patients and is not one to fix everything with a pill. She is attentive, answers questions you may have, and my favorite part has got to be the patient portal she makes available to every patient. On the patient portal you can contact Dr. Gartenberg via a messenger to ask for prescription refills if needed, view lab results and book appointments. Dr. Gartenberg has a great bedside manner and puts you at ease and explains everything to you. Since I have been seeing Dr. Gartenberg she has inspired me to try and live a healthier lifestyle and I haven't felt this good healthwise in years! Thank you Dr. Gartenberg you are awesome!\n",

      "       After struggling with finding a new doctor with our new insurance I was scared to go to just anyone. I wanted someone who would be dedicated to holistic methods when needed and modern medicine when needed. Elissa B. Gartenberg's qualifications were astounding and she seemed too good to be true. Yesterday I had my first visit and she is just amazing! You can tell she really cares about her patients. She is a breath of fresh air in the medical industry! The nurse upfront was amazing as well. They took their time with me, no rush at all. They went above and beyond my expectations. Her office was bright, clean and inviting. I'm so thrilled that I have found a doctor that I really enjoy. I have made her my primary. Her office is in Scottsdale and my home on the other side of the valley but I am happy to drive to get to her.\n",

      "       Elissa R Gartenberg, D.O., has opened Modern Family Medicine in downtown Scottsdale. Her degrees in Medicine certainly will impress you. Her office offers regular medicine, holistic health activities, and an oxygen bar. I don't think this is going to be your typical Doctor's office. I thought my experience with Dr. Gartenberg,would strictly be business, helping to provide the artwork for her office. However, while doing that I had a medical situation which affecting me a bit one day. She took the time to stop and discuss it with me which was certainly impressive as she certainly had no obligation to do it. If this was any representation of how she practices, I think any one would be impressed by the quality of she approaches her work. She is also very down to earth in discussing things with you. Finding the office can be a bit of a challenge but that is not the worst thing is it? There is also parking in the back which they can show you once you get there. I think it would be well worth your time to find her!\n",

      "       I love the passion and detailed approached that Dr Fernandez brings to her practice. Not many doctors will care to the level that she does. She instills that she and her office are there for you. They are also available for questions and concerns. She will be your health advocate and do it the way YOUR body wants to heal the illnesses and not the cookie-cutter approaches of taking pills just to mask your illness. As a holistic healer myself whose specialty is to help others with raising the vibrations of their emotional, mental and spiritual bodies, I know that we need to bring our physical body up as well so that our 4-body system works optimally. We need to bring the physical body in top performance so that we can function smoothly like four tires on a car. If one of the tires is deflated or over inflated, the car doesn't operate efficiently and will break down. The same thing happens when our 4-body system is not connected and working in unison. We need to feel positive emotions, think positive thoughts, be connected with our core truth, and perform our machine, the physical body, smoothly. Dr. Fernandez does give you a complimentary appointment so why not see if she can be part of your own personal health team. She is on my team! Thank you, Tina Sacchi\n",

      "       We have been coming here since it was Foothill Peds. We love Dr Faro and his staff. Especially Mr John, he is the best! They have made a few changes since the switch over. They no longer take 3 kids at a time. I can understand why but if you are a family who has always done that and haven't cancelled or no showed I think you should be able to continue. My kids (twins and singleton) birthdays are 3 weeks apart and they always get sick at the same time. It is a pain to have 3 sick kids and you have to take 2 one day and the other the next. Last time all 3 were with me because I didn't have anyone to watch the one without an appointment and John was so kind to offer to take the 3rd. So I guess they bend the rules sometimes. I am not one to push the issue. The front office staff has greatly improved. For awhile there was a new person every time we went and most weren't pleasant. Now it is the same girl and she is great. Another plus, we never wait more than 5 minutes to be called back.\n",

It's now 4 pm and all they can tell me is we are next! If I would've known this in advance at least I could've stopped and got my daughter something to eat before we got here.

      "       I love Dr. Faro and have had him as my sons doctor for almost 10 years now! I have not one negative thing to say about this doctor. He is amazing and honestly the only doctor I have ever felt confident in. He really takes his time to answer questions and explain things. I never feel rushed here and that's amazing because with the time he takes with you, you'd think it would cause longer wait times, but somehow the wait times are never excessive. He's had the same make nurse since I've been coming here and I think that's awesome, he's a super nice guy, always has a smile, very professional and respectful. Sometimes the front office staff is questionable on their attitudes it's kind of hit or miss with who is at the front but recently they have been ok up there. Yes the office waiting room could be more kid friendly, there isn't anything for kids to do while they wait as there is only a line of chairs in the waiting room, but maybe there's a reason kids have germs and providing toys etc out there could cause kids to get sick while waiting at the doctors office, so to me that's a logical reason. It's def not a reason to turn away from this office, I truly feel dr faro is one of the best and I feel very lucky to have found him as my child's first doctor! I recommend Dr. Faro to everyone I know with kids. Thank you Dr. Faro for all that you do!\n",

      "       Dr Faro has been my youngest child's Dr since he was born almost 9 years ago, and my other 2 children's Doctor for just as long. His male nurse that takes their measurements at the beginning of the appointment is always friendly and patient. The front office staff is prompt and courteous. I thought I was going to have to suffer through those dreaded long wait times in a pediatric Dr's office, especially now that Dr. Faro is the sole Doctor at this practice. I have never had to wait for longer than 20 minutes after my appointment time. I do understand that emergencies come up and a child who needs to be seen before mine may happen. Dr Faro is always polite, speaks to my kiddos and does their exam in a manner in which they never feel afraid or uncomfortable. The waiting area is clean but simple, but I don't come here for the dÃ©cor. My child gets the medical attention in which we were there for, and they have always left with no tears and a lollipop of their choice.\n",

The first time I stepped into the store I was totally impressed with their selection of everything but especially the cheese section. AND...most of the cheeses you can sample without asking someone for it. I have never had items from the hot table but I bought the in-store made spelt crust pizza. Oh my gosh, best, best pizza ever. But what brings me back to Nature's Emporium in Newmarket is the staff at this store. Super friendly, EXTREM knowledgable. You just need to look at a product for 2 seconds and someone ask you if you need help with this item or if you have any other questions. I got very useful free tips on health and diet.\n",

      "       4.5 stars overall. -0.5 star because they have limited choice of hot table; my kids couldn't find anything to eat for lunch there. Firstly, cheese section, LOVED IT! They have a lot of sample available and the lady working in the cheese section was extremely helpful and able to find the right cheese for you and your family. Fresh bread from Ace Bakery: not a lot of choice but more selection under frozen section. I noticed that their baby section is getting smaller and less selection for the past few times I went. They used to carry vegan colour crayons and other art and craft toys but not anymore but for baby food section, it's pretty much remained the same. We got most of our baking, cosmetics and supplements there. When they were on sale, you would able to find a very good deal. This store is much bigger than the one in Vaughan. If driving is not an issue, I strongly recommend you to go to this location. I usually grabbed a coffee on my way out. They usually have deal for coffee and one bakery item for $4 or something. I feel much better to eat their bakery goods than those at *bucks :) They also have roasted whole chicken deal for $25 or something with 2 salads, yummy organic chicken. They have excellent customer service; everyone work there are very friendly and helpful. They never run out of buggies/shopping carts. I found that it's a bit hard to find a parking even during weekdays. They have two sitting ares and both of them are nice and clean; no sticky tables and chairs YEAH!!!\n",

      "       Great store. The people in the supplement/medicine section are extremely helpful and take time to explain your different options for whatever you are looking for. Although the products can be quite expensive, it's worth the money...at least for most things. I really trust this store and I know all their products are organic so I don't have to spend time looking at the labels. It's very clean and the layout of the store is done in an efficient manner. They have a nice variety of organic prepared food that you can take out Great store, highly recommended for vegetarians.\n",

      "       Great gluten free and organic hot table Their grocery can be expensive for organic but i trust their buyers over Fortinos their POS system likes to overcharge with no apology or credit The sign says $2.99 and the charge $3.29 And other examples i cannot be bothered with explaining They have a Hot Table for lunch and I had Thai Curry, some salad, and Quinoa and it came out to almost $20 . Expensive for sure but it was very good Extensive cheese selection is impressive but is higher priced compared to Grande Cheese Organic shopping continues to be very expensive but they offer a huge selection with poor customer service Take advantage of their sales but after feeling gouged at the cash and going through multiple price checks for miss priced items at check out I feel i dont need the extra work to keep them honest. If you cant keep your POS accurate then it means your dishonest. Never, ever had this concern with their competitors When you feel that you are taken for granted and have check out anxiety then it is time to move on to other retailers They do not price match. Walmart had a PGX promo and they would not bother to match. I know go to Walmart and price match against their flyer pricing. Who thought to shop the big W for organics?\n",

      "       Hands down the best organic food store I've ever been to. This is why: 1) You don't have to worry about carefully reading the product label - you can trust their selection. 2) They carry ranges of quality so you have product depth as well and have a choice in how much you want to spend. 3) They have excellent sales every now and then and it can turn you into a Hoarder! 4) They carry a wide range of products from prepared foods, groceries, cleaning supplies, baby supplies to vitamins. 5) Staff are so well trained its shocking. Seriously, go ask the meat deli for chia seeds and you'll still get an answer -and a recommendation too while they're at it. I love what they've done here and I can't wait to see a southern expansion. My only complaint is that they need a little bit of a bigger selection on their sushi grade fish and beef. Otherwise kudos to carrying ostrich; bison and varying qualities of chicken.\n",

They have exceptional customer service and the largest selection of supplements. I went in for something they didn't carry (which is very unusual) and they immediately offered to get it for me. My order came quickly, it came when they said it would, and they called me as soon as it was in. This is the kind of service I appreciate and that is why I don't go anywhere else. They have a wide variety of teas which I love - kinds you can't get in regular grocery stores. Their prices are slightly higher than other stores but everything is good quality. The staff is always friendly and helpful and I always leave with what I was looking for. A great place to visit in Newmarket!\n",

      "       I like a lot of things about Natures Emporeum and one thing that I DON'T like: It's too far away from my house LOL. The store moved into the space previously occupied by Weston Produce (remember them?) And upped the game. You have: - a lot of healthy food options, all under one roof - prices that are on the high side but more tamed than those at many other organic / natural food places I've been to - many products from local farms. - some products that (as far as I know) can only be found here Examples? I can think of a few: - Whole cocoa beans (the closest I could find is cocoa bits at Whole Foods) - Cocoa bits covered in dark chocolate (great alternative to candy and other sugary stuff) - Cool glass canisters for sprouting ... and I'm sure there are more things that I can't remember now or don't know about. All in all, my favourite store. Wish it was a bit closer.\n",

      "       I will never return to this dentist. First appt: A technician took full x-rays of every kind that would normally be taken in a dental clinic, and I met and talked with Dr. Wolfe about some painful sensitivity in my teeth. He then checked teeth for receding gums, and I was asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding what I like or dislike about my teeth or smile. The questionnaire put up a red-flag simply because I felt this was along the lines of a cosmetic dentistry as opposed to a dentist whose main concern is the health of your teeth and gums. When it was clear that the appt was over, I asked about cleaning my teeth and was then informed that I would have to schedule another appt for that. WHAT?? I took time off from work for this!! Second appt: Get to dentist and the hygienist, who was really VERY good, cleaned my teeth. Afterwards, yet again, it was clear that the appt was over, and I had not EVEN seen the dentist. When I asked her if I was going to see the dentist, she said she would ask him to come in to see me. First off, I have NEVER, EVER been to a dentist that did NOT come into the room to re-check my teeth after the hygienist had finished cleaning my teeth - no matter HOW GOOD SHE IS! I declined her offer to go get him as well as her offer to schedule another appt in 6 mos. I knew I would NOT be coming back to this dentist. While checking out, the receptionist also asked about scheduling another appt, and again, I declined. She then handed me a \"Proposed Treatment Plan\" that Dr. Wolfe had worked up for me. This plan consisted of 2 more visits, with him replacing what appears to be 6 fillings (3 per visit) according to the paper handed to me, and to the tune of $744.00 - the full price before my dental insurance kicks in! THERE WILL BE NO THIRD APPT!!! .\n",

      "       I first found the Newman Chiropractic Center about 2 years ago when one day, my lower back pain got so severe I could barely walk. I called one or two other Chiropractic offices first and neither could see me that morning or even that same day. Dr. Novak at the Newman Chiropractic Center was able to see me immediately and since that day, I've never even thought about going anywhere else. Whenever I need an adjustment, I simply call ahead and let them know I'll be stopping in; they are extremely flexible and understanding of my busy schedule. I look forward to visiting the office for an adjustment because I know that when I leave, I will feel amazing. The office itself is not as posh as you might find other places in Shady Side but it's welcoming, comfortable, and certainly gets the job done. I have and will continue to highly recommend Dr. Novak to anyone who is need of Chiropractic care.\n",

But then he did some kind of very sharp, twisting, pushing adjustment to a part of my back that was not hurting when I went in, but caused an intense back spasm as a result. Left in terrible pain. While he and the assistant were kind and concerned, they also blamed my alleged out-of-alignment back. I entered his office with a mild but persistent hip problem and left with an upper back injury that is severe enough to not be able to move. Hard to trust a practice after that - definitely do not recommend.\n",

I start to feel better a week later and then start to feel even worse. Go into another urgent care they ran a lot of test to find out I have walking pneumonia. I told them about my visit at this urgent care and the Dr. Couldn't believe that's what happened at the first visit. Our health care system doesn't care about people any more it's about how many people was can push thru the fastes and get the most money out of them. Unreal\n",

      "       I normally don't review especially if nothing good to say but I have to make a comment on this place. Just as a side note I will never go to Dr visit but once a year and other than that I stick it through regardless of the pain. This time I went in because I couldn't even function due to severe lower back pain. I went in and was pretty dead, I was seen within 20min of my visit. Seen by Dr. Deusterman and he was awesome by the way. Bad starts after I left. Went to pick up my prescription and they had no record of it, called NextCare to find out they sent to wrong pharmacy. They said they would sent to correct. 1hr later pharmacy didn't have anything. Called Nextcare again and then two hrs later went to pick up and no record of the meds. Called Nextcare again and requested follow up call. spoke to Gloria directly and she stated that she doesn't know why there was no prescription but states Jose was on the phone now talking to pharmacy. Never got my callback but felt confident and a total of 4.5 hrs later went back and no record. Explained to pharmacy and Elena asked other workers and no one had received a call from Nextcare. So at this point I went in paid my money to Nextcare to get pain meds which I still can't see 5hrs later and my pain is now worse. When speaking to Nextcare they seem to not have a worry in the world, no apology or any kind of sympathy. Worse experience ever. Still in pain and no meds...real quick to take my money though. So yea ppl may seem nice but completely incompetent.\n",

      "       After being a life-long chain eyecare customer (Nationwide, Lenscrafters, Eyemasters, etc), I finally decided to go with North Phoenix Eye Care because I now have vision-specific insurance, and these folks take it. Right off the bat, everything went well: appointment was made, then, on Friday, I got a call that they had an opening the next day that I could take if I wanted. Awesome! Show up for my appointment and my Dr, Chelsea Crandell, is just plain awesome. That perfect blend of professionalism and personality to make me feel both at-ease (which I need when somebody's holding a metal device 1\" from my eyeball) and comfortable that she knows what she's doing. Every step of the way she kept me informed on what she was doing and seeing and very informative on what my options are. I really can't recommend these folks enough.

They said they would call me once it arrived. No one called me after a week and a half, so I called and they said \"ohh yea, it's here.\" So needless to say: if they don't have it in stock your better off just ordering it online yourself.

Protein choices are limited and tried to get me on a brand I've never seen or heard of in my life, making me think its an exclusive brand and more then likely crap. I got a free sample which sounds nice, but I didn't even ask for that style of protein. As far as other supplements go, they only carry popular stuff, not quality. Preworkout selection is minimal at best. Prices are also high. For everything but protein Vegas discount across the street is a lot cheaper with a much bigger variety. Either way in order to get legit protein in this city in gonna go Internet.\n",

      "       Highly Unrecommended Business Out of all sports nutrition stores, Nutrishop LV should rank last on your list. I have never come across a business that does the following: 1) sells products and bad mouths those products after you purchase them saying; 2) put down ALL products I was willing to put down good money for (Optimum Nutrition, Muscle Milk, BSN, USP labs); 3) dishonor flyers claiming to have the \"best prices in Las Vegas\" and \"beat Internet prices\" (the flyer with no expiration date stated specific prices for products but not honored in store); 4) give false information like \"you shouldn't take Creatine because it accumulates mucus in your kidneys\" then have a Store Manager back up such claims saying, \"that associate knows a lot and I back him up 100%\"; 5) a Store Manager saying, \"I wouldn't even buy that stuff\" after purchasing the product; 6) a store manager assuming that the product I have been taking does not work on me by saying, \"well since it hasn't been working on you, you should try this [pointing to a generic protein vs ON Pro Complex]\" I am sorry, but this business is exactly how a business shouldn't run. Products should not be put down, especially if it up on your shelves, especially when just purchased. Do NOT put down your customers by assuming a product is not working by merely looking at the customer (I have gained 30 lbs of mass since taking ON, a product that the Store Manager was bad mouthing). Do NOT pretend that you know much about nutrition and implement your knowledge on your customers (I work in Nephrology and from what I know, there are no mucus membranes in the kidneys). Do NOT put out flyers claiming \"the best prices in Las Vegas\" when the nutrition store across the street sells products 10% cheaper. Do NOT belittle your customers by putting down their favorite products and suggesting generic products. I will not return to this business even with managerial action plans or interventions. I am disappointed with this company. Rated 0.5/5 stars for bad business but a clean store.\n",

      "       Can't even begin to explain how amazing Dr Maya is! I am by nature a Hypochondriac and paranoid person but if there's any Doctor I trust with my Heath, it's Dr Maya Pande. It's not the vast experience she has or her long list of patients (it quite busy during the evenings) or the friendly and warm inviting feeling I get when I enter the front office but it's the Doctor's approach to all my concerns, queries and her understanding that makes her an outstanding Doctor. I first came to her when I had injured my left arm while lifting weights. I had done such a bang up job that I couldn't even put on a shirt without wincing in pain. After my second visit, not only was I able to move my arm but the pain subsided substantially. That was 2.5 years ago and I've been going to her ever since. I now see her once a week for maintenance !\n",

      "       I've been seeing Dr. Maya for more than a year now and I have never felt better. And I've been to at least 4 other chiropractors over the last 10 years. Her gentle method had me skeptical at first, truth be told, but it delivers great results! No scary twisting or cracking. My neck and back pain are FINALLY well managed and my overall health has been excellent (fewer colds and illnesses). She's able to pinpoint the exact areas where there is a misalignment, so I always leave her office feeling SO much better. Other chiropractors' methods seem more \"general\" so I'd sometimes leave still feeling \"off.\" She is a wonderful resource for holistic health information, too. Dr. Maya is such a lovely, caring person and her receptionist, Tsering, is wonderful, too! Definitely highly recommend Pande Family Chiropractic to anyone who is looking for chiropractic care for themselves OR their children.\n",

      "       I started seeing Dr. Maya when I was pregnant with my first baby. I wanted to optimize my body for labour and prevent any aches and pains. I'm happy to say I didn't have any back pain that is common in pregnancy and had a smooth and quick labour. Dr. Maya also adjusted my newborn baby girl at 2 weeks old when we were having breastfeeding issues and she wouldn 't latch. After only one adjustment, we saw major improvement with my daughter. We were able to latch her every time after that. I went from breastfeeding 25-50% of time (and giving her a bottle the rest of the time) to getting her latched on the breast 100% of the time. I'm very grateful for this end result and my daughter and I will continue to see Dr. Maya for our health.\n",

      "       This yelp is about an event that Pande Family Wellness Centre puts on bi-annually. ~~~ I've twice visited them to attend \"From Bellies to Babies\". It's a free event offered to all expectant and new parents. I spent the bulk of yesterday (10:30-3:30) there, and spoke with so many specialists - psychotherapist, nutritionists, massage therapist, lactation consultant, baby goods distributor, pre/postpartum fitness instructor, and of course Maya the chiropractor was there. Everyone was sincere and quite pleasant to chat with. There were workshops held each half hour, and rooms to breast/feed in and for babies/toddies to play in, in the interim. It was a really worthwhile experience, both times that I went. I think it's amazing, that this wellness clinic would do this for an expectant/ new parent community. ~ They are near Eglinton X Yonge st. If possible, I'd recommend taking the TTC there, OR there is indoor parking just west of a green P where the daily max. is $12, as opposed to the nasty $22. that I ended up paying.\n",

      "       Just had a treatment at Paradise Reflexology &amp; Massage. Woah....worth every moment and every penny!!! I had a 60-minute foot massage. YoYo did such an amazing job! My treatment felt so luxurious and I am so relaxed! My massage felt so rich and calming I felt sure it lasted more than 60 minutes. When she told me we were done, I glanced at the clock as she was right on time. I am so happy with my experience and will absolutely be back! At this price, I may make this a regular thing. They offer several different types of treatments, like full-body massage, detox foot treatments and foot massages. The prices all seem to be on the low end, but it felt like a high-end spa treatment! If you follow this review and find yourself parked in a small strip mall with a Circle K and a Mail Box Store, you're in exactly the right place. Inside their establishment, the rooms are clean and the lights are dim with quiet relaxing music - perfect for disconnecting from the outside distractions and reconnecting with your inner calm. Thank you, YoYo! This was a REALLY great experience!\n",

      "       I went in for a wellness exam. Told the person that I had been sick for 3 weeks, I couldn't keep any food and barely water down, and had lost a significant amount of weight. Blood work and an ultrasound was recommended. Blood work was complete on 9/11 and ultrasound was complete on 9/12. No contact from this office at all. I had to call them on 9/15 to find out if they knew anything, what the next step was, I am still in pain. I was told that they were waiting on the provider to sign off on the results so they could contact me. I explained the seriousness of the situation and was told that they would try to get it signed off and needed me to come in to get the results. I was told that they close at 3pm and would need to be there by 2:15 to get seen. I told them that I would not make it in time and can I have my results over the phone, I said that I know I need to see a GI specialist, is the doctor recommending that, can we please get that started because I am not doing any better. I was told that they would call me back. Two hours later, I receive a phone call regarding my results but I still needed to come in to see the doctor. Was told I could come in on Saturday but it was first come first serve. Went in Saturday morning and met with this doctor. Told him I was in horrible pain, I had lost 7 more pounds since Monday, still was not able to keep any food and fluids down, and I was extremely dehydrated. The doctor wanted me to go see a GI and prescribed some mild pain pill and something for acid reflux. This location actually has a GI on site and when I tried to make the appointment, they lady said she needed to find out what type of ultrasound the doctor wanted done but he was with another patient and I could wait or she would call me when she found out. I told her I was in alot of pain can she please call me so we can schedule it. Never got a phone call even though I left 3 messages! I had to go to the ER because I was so dehydrated, that's not fair that I have to pay for an ER visit when I asked this doctor to be hydrated. On Monday, 9/18, I missed work due to pain and called around to find the soonest availability for a GI. I found one that could see me the next day. Still no word from this clinic. Finally today, 9/20, I get a call regarding my referral. The lady says they referred me to the Arizona Digestive Health, I told her that they did not, I found her on my own because they never got back to me. All she said was that she would let the provider know. I don't want anything to do with this clinic, I am switching primary care doctors asap and I don't want this clinic to have anything to do with my situation ever again. This clinic just called my girlfriend back with her lab results today and she also went in on 9/11/2017 with me. How does it take a week and a half to get result back or to hear back from this clinic? No information has been updated on our Aetna member page regarding our visit to this clinic but my visit yesterday is already showing up! This place is a joke and I feel that they did not take my situation seriously!!\n",

      "       The actual procedure was just alright but the billing department is the worst. They gave bad codes to the diagnostics lab and instead of getting free lab work done i was charged $250. On calling them they made me run around here and there and everytime i called some new person gave me excuses to which lab test was supposed to be covered under my insurance. They cannot tell me which lab work is covered under which code. total lack of respect for the customer. I had clearly told them i want to get the preventive test done which is covered 100% by my insurance, if they still went ahead and got tests which are not covered, why am i liable for it. Avoid this place at any cost. Clearly the worst case of customer service i have ever seen. Im not being biased, i have called 10 times and still nowhere close to being resolved.\n",

      "       I wouldn't even give this place one star. I went there ONCE and it was to obtain a new family dr as well as get a referral to a pain dr for my chronic pain. All was fine at first, the dr gave me a referral and I was on my way. I ended up in the ER in excruciating pain but the ER dr wouldn't do anything until he spoke with my family dr. That was ok with me so I gave him the phone number to this clinic. The family dr I had seen only one time told the ER dr that he was treating me for pain medicine addiction and to not help me! Seriously! I'm not an addict for one and this dr had seen me only one time. Mind you, he gave me a referral to a pain dr which wouldn't make sense if I were an addict. I wasn't even asking for meds I just wanted the pain to go away at that time in the ER. This so called family dr lied about what I had gone to him for. Never going back to this place. Only go here if you want a dr to lie to another dr about your healthcare. So unprofessional and slandering.\n",

      "       I don't have insurance and needed a place to be seen at a reasonable rate. Decent charge for seeing a doc without insurance and I signed up for the discount program. $50 a year/$50 an office visit. The program has other discounts as well. I went on a Monday and the wait was 20 minutes at most. The same or better than a private doc. They told me it was a good day to come because usually it is jam packed. I recommend coming here if you have no insurance and need to see someone quickly. I saw Dr. Beck and she was wonderful. No kidding, I would rather see her than some of the docs I have seen in the past. Ask for Dr. Beck. You will be pleased. :)\n",

      "       I hate to leave a bad review but this dental office does not deserve my business. I made an appointment with Rainsprings Dental Group because I am new to the area and needed a local dentist. I found the office using yelp and immediately made an appointment because of all the good reviews. I also used the address listed on yelp to find the location which is NOT correct! I ended up at their old location and luckily was early enough to get to the new location on time. I provided all my insurance information hours before my appointment. After waiting for 45 minutes past my appointment time I was finally called up to the desk and was advised they were unable to verify my Insurance with the provider. At that point the insurance office was already closed as they are on EST and I was not not able to see the Dr. I work for an insurance carrier and I know it takes a matter of minutes to verify insurance. I am extremely upset that this office wasted 45 minutes of my time and waited till after my appointment time to verify insurance. I will not be rescheduling an appointment!\n",

Most times at other dentists they'll schedule the cleaning for another date. I really loved that I felt they did not try to up charge or pressure me into anything. They could have told me to replace my crown like my last dentist, but instead said no it's fine so why spend the money we can adjust your filling and solve your issue. Really felt good about their advice and even better about their customer service!\n",

I had a cleaning done at a prior dentist the week before and sadly to say I was dissatisfied. So I made an appointment here and they meet my expectation and beyond. I have now found my go to dentist from now on. I strongly encourage everyone to give them a try.\n",

Needless to say, I ended up having to go to the dentist last week and was scheduled to see Dr. Shepherd. I was so nervous, I was literally shaking. All the staff was so reassuring and truly tried putting me at ease from the start. When it was time for my procedure, Dr. Shepherd talked me through everything and constantly was checking to make sure I was okay. I had to get quite a bit done and was concerned about the pain after the novocaine wore off... but there was NONE!! I highly recommend them for anyone needing a dentist... but especially if you have a fear like mine.... they will change your mind about going to the dentist!!\n",

      "       I moved here from Illinois, and I expect the front desk to be incompetent. That is not even the word for the front desk at this office. They do not greet you, or even smile. They basically speak when they want their money. They messed up my appointment, did not apologize for it, even after I told them that I had a death in the family that morning! I asked if I could be seen next, since they messed up my appointment time (Christina) and both the doctor (Dr. Christopher Bringhurst) stated I should go somewhere else since I did not trust his staff. How rude! He seems to value people like himself...because he was surely quick to get rid of me, even after stating his staff messed up. Both my husband and I were patients there (obv. not the right color for him), but that office, nor that company will ever get my business again! I will be sure to tell all my friends and family, because no one should be subjected to such rudeness. At the end of the day, you have to go somewhere and get all new x-rays, but they could care less. Horrible treatment, and no remorse for their behavior, even when they know they were wrong!\n",

I can probably write a novel about the service at Rainsprings Dental Group, but I'll shorten it for this Yelp review! :-) I am terrified of dentists and the cost that comes with them. All of my fears were not only acknowledged, but they are conquered. All information is broken down completely and they offer a vast amount of treatment options and their recommendation. Dr. John Shepherd is kind, knowledgeable and very patient. I was freaking out over a procedure, he was able to calm me down and together we came up with an affordable game plan. Christina is extremely sweet and she will work the financials out with you in no time! You will not be disappointed with their service and I thank them for the beautiful smile they've given me!\n",

I'm surprised because staff come in to get all sorts of stuff in this room. You could hear loud voices as if they're having a party. There were candies on the countertop. The sink looked dirty. Staff from the other cubicles would come to the room where my daughter was getting her treatment to get candies. I have not seen anyone wash their hands so far. (Maybe I just don't see from where I am.). I had to say something until the staff told me that \"she always sanitizes her hands before each patient\" but I sure saw the surprise in her face when I asked her about it. I do not expect for customers to be treated as royalty however, coming in and out of the room to me is a violation of privacy. This review is constructive. Thank you.\n",

      "       I have had the worst experience of my life....been in pain for over a month; it all began with a routine cleaning and after the cleaning, I was told I should redo one of my crowns and a \"big\" cavity...so I believed them and said okay lets take preventative measures and get it all done...I do not have dental insurance so one of the girls came to tell me the price with the cash discounts for all of the dental work to be done and the dentist \"Bringhurst\" got right on it. Same day! I thought great only one visit and its all done. OH NO! Immediately after the procedures I started having pain. This was normal for the first few days but oh no this continued all week...My crown had to be redone a second time. I could not eat or drink ANYTHING...Another week goes by and the pain continues EVERYWHERE in my mouth; everything was hurting; the lower jaw, gums; everywhere; I couldn't sleep; the \"Doctor B\" told me to take pain medication and ibuprofen...3 weeks into this, I went to their office 4 times....and still the stories continues; 4th week in pain and then I am told I need to wear a night guard...more money out the door; 5th week STILL in pain...so I return AGAIN in tears and I am told to call a dentist that specializes in TMJ...something really went wrong so I decide to get a second opinion and a third opinion for different dentists....still in pain and crying and not able to chew, drink, or sleep; both the other dentist said I needed root canals on both teeth that \"Doctor B\" worked on. This dentist infected all the teeth he worked on. This place has giving me so much pain, I would NEVER NEVER NEVER recommend them to ANYONE!!!!! I have now came out of pocket for two root canals and 4 additional visits... Overall they have caused nothing but a NIGHTMARE!\n",

They also inform you about what they're doing step by step and they offer different payment options to make paying for your treatment easier. Love this place. Great staff and great service.\n",

      "       So I went back to see a new doctor and he totally messed up my tooth. Now it's aching and I'm afraid I have an infection. So some of the things he did that made me upset: After he injected the numbing liquid, I felt a lot of extra liquid coming out and instead having me spit it out, he asked me to swallow it. HELL NO! Then what, my throat is going to be numb. Yeah I don't think so. After grinding my molars down to prep it for partial crown, he tells me to swallow the water he just sprayed on my mouth along with the residue from my teeth. Isn't that why they have those suction tools for? If you as me that's just pure laziness or experienced Doctor. He did this throughout the procedure. Then he would prep my mouth so that he can start working on my tooth, then walk away. UMMM hello! You've been working on my tooth for awhile now and my mouth has been opened 90% of the time. Just because I am numb, it doesn't mean it's ok to have me keep my mouth open and walk away to ask another doctor if whatever your doing is correct? My husband was outside and saw him come out multiple times during my procedure. Lastly, when I made my appointment today, after I already complained about his work, the lady in the front puts me with him again. Isn't there notes that say, I don't want the new guy! Now I have to go back and probably have to pay more money because someone did a crappy job and messed up my tooth. It never felt the way it did until they worked on it and it's been over 3 weeks. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and see if the pain went away but it didn't. If you come here make sure you see someone experienced. DO NOT see someone that's been there for a few months. As far as cleaning and the basics, this new doctor was good. When things get complicated, I would look somewhere else. Wishing I could change dentist right now but I'm stuck. Oh yeah the X-ray technician and the assistant were all very nice. They seemed to know how to do things better than the new dentist. Just saying. Be careful who you book with.\n",

      "       My experience with Rainsprings Dental was spectacular! I had a fancy new filling put in by Dr. Abalos and two wisdom teeth extracted by Dr. Sorensen. The receptionists are extremely professional, prompt, and knowledgable. Their dental assistants were very patient and thorough while taking my X-rays with their top of the line equipment. Dr. Abalos is a fabulous dentist! She explained everything to me in regular English, not dentist lingo. I could seriously go on and on about how sweet, gentile, friendly, and funny she is but let's move on to the man who pulled my wisdom teeth in 30 minutes. The oral surgeon Dr. Sorensen. Amazing. His hands have been blessed by the gods. I'm so glad I've found a dentist for life!\n",

      "       Came here a few weeks ago. So my experience was rather indifferent. I came here for a teeth cleaning to be covered by my dental plan. After the initial x-rays, I was given sales pitch after sales pitch trying to sell me things I simply just don't need, which by the way, aren't covered by insurance conveniently. I rejected all offers and told them I don't want to do anything not covered by the insurance. They are a nice dentist office, but the high pressure sales tactics made me feel as if I was in a timeshare meeting. My wife never got her teeth cleaning and instead was told she needs several thousands of dollars worth of work. Very uncool and unprofessional.\n",

      "       Probably one of the best dentist I've been to. The entire staff was very friendly, not forced, phony friendly, just genuinely nice people. Some reviewers complained about the place seeming disorganized. I found quite the opposite, they seemed to be very organized. Very short waits in the waiting room and exam room and everyone seemed to execute their job like clockwork and they were always ready for the next procedure. All equipment seemed very modern, and best of all, they use X-rays that don't cut the crap out of your mouth. Dr. Bringhurst found some minor problems in my mouth (apparently I'm a night teeth grinder) that several dentist over the years have missed and offered remedies it as part of the service, not for the sake of an upsell. I have good dental insurance; though at every other dentist I've been to the past several years, I walked out paying between $60-200 every time for God knows what even though cleanings and exams are included. I actually had a $0 balance walking out of here, I have a feeing that before Rainsprings, I was being upsold on certain things that I wasn't being told was extra. I did however elect to have an in office whitening in which they did a wonderful job. A great dental office and as long as I am in Vegas, i will be a happy client of theirs.\n",

      "       This review is for my recent cleaning visit. I will review the oral surgeon services next week once I have had my wisdom teeth out. :( I had the unfortunate need for a deep cleaning since it had been 4 years since my last dental visit. But, honestly, Heidi made the experience so amazing that I would not mind having to go through it all again. I am terrified of the dentist (it's funny, but the worst part for me would have to be the x-rays). The front office staff at Rainsprings always seem to be cheerful and happy to help their patients. I knew that my cleaning would take a long time, so I came mentally prepared for my 2.5 hour visit. Heidi, my hygienist, was sincerely friendly and made sure that I was comfortable the entire time I was in the chair. I seriously did not feel a thing when she numbed my mouth (except for the laser treatment, but that didn't even hurt that bad). By the end of the cleaning, my teeth felt sparkling clean. Heidi suggested I start using a Sonicare toothbrush. They sell these in the office for $119 with a $10 rebate. I opted to order mine online since I had an Amazon gift card. The toothbrush is definitely great, and I'm hoping it will improve the health of my gums permanently! I have never felt more comfortable in regards to a dental office. While I know I will still cringe at the thought of going to the dentist, I feel a bit more relaxed knowing that I will receive great care and service from this office!\n",

      "       Came here to try the infrared wrap with a epsom salt body scrub. I had a not so good experience when it comes to wrap so I was skeptical to have it again thinking it was the same as the universal wrap. When I tried, it changed my whole perspective of the kind of wrap I came for. I sweat like I workout the whole day, never sweat like that in my whole life and I'm for sure doing this as my biweekly routine. The only downer, the spa has no shower but it's okay. I suggest, hydrate before your schedule wrap and bring Gatorade or water in your massage room though, they'll give you electrolytes after to replenish your lost fluid . I came on a busy day and no one was doing the receptionist job but the lady who did my wrap so it took her a while to come back and check on me. But overall, it's a great detoxifying experience.\n",

The environment is positive and focussed on true holistic health. The entire experience leaves you feeling like you have treated and spoiled yourself! I have insomnia and for a few days after the treatment I sleep like a baby which is a welcome relief. To add some extra relaxation to the wrap, try an infared sauna before the wrap! I love those as well!! :) I would urge all that are considering this treatment to try one... you will be hooked !! Elanna, the owner, is seriously the sweetest most genuine person and will do everything to make your visit worthwhile. Rhiannon\n",

      "       I've been part of many boot camps, gyms, and studios, and this location of Fit Body Boot Camp is definitely among the best. They cap their class sizes at 15 which is great, because it keeps the classes from getting too crowded. And because they keep the class sizes small, the coaches are able to give everyone personal attention during the session. They're constantly giving you feedback helping to make sure you are doing each exercise properly. This is especially important, because doing exercises improperly leaves you susceptible to injures and prevents you from getting the most out of each exercise. THIS is what's missing at many of the other boot camps, gyms, and studios. THIS is why I think, based on other people's reviews, so many people seem to get results here. Each session is only 30 minutes too so it is perfect for people with busy schedules. And to people who think 30 minutes is short, it is not. They will work you HARD during that 30 minutes. When I first started, I couldn't walk for 3 days. 30 minutes here is better than an hour at a lot of other places. Additionally, all the coaches are positive, motivating, patient, and makes an effort to get to know everyone and learn everyone's name. They discuss your goals with you, help you keep track of your progress, and give you tips and advise on how to meet your goals. And while I haven't had the chance to attend any of the socials, they do organize events for members (such as hiking). All in all, Fit Body Boot Camp at Rhodes Ranch is a great option for anyone that's serious about getting in shape and staying in shape.\n",

      "       I just wanted to say how impressed I was at the knowledge and passion of Coach Kirk. He explains everything to you first so you're not as timid. I went to this location back in March-April. I always wanted to try bootcamp and choose this location (nearby). I went in to get stronger. I had been struggling with back problems and was scared to try bootcamp thought it may make it worse. On top of my back pain I had some degree of knee pain (wore a knee brace) since 2008. Coach Kirk gave me a little one on one talk and some pointers on posture. I expressed my concerns and he told me to try a workout without my brace with the way he showed me to do the workouts and I haven't worn a brace since then. The place is clean, everyone is very nice and class goes by quick (they make you sweat lol). Coach will help with whatever your goals are. Him and his wife Pam are sweethearts, make a great team. Anyone debating on trying bootcamp but nervous?! This is your place to go! They know what they are doing, make you feel comfortable and you will get results.\n",

Its inspired my 18 yr old daughter of whom lives in Manhattan (where all the great food is at) to get involved with health and all the benefits from it. Its not only your physical body changing but it truly strengthens and helps your mind with better focus and clarity.The staff here was truly amazing, knowledgeable and amongst anything, genuine and sincere about their passion at hand. If you commit as I did and do as instructed, results you will see. Thank you coach Kirk and staff for helping me reach my goals.\n",

The owner, Pam, is very kind and helpful, but the trainer, Kirk, was very \"sale-sy\" which wasn't appreciated. If I alert you to knee discomfort, I'm not asking for an additional \"$55 nutrient assessment,\" but rather looking for modifications on exercises to not get hurt. If I come in on a Groupon, don't try to up-sale me to a 6-mo. plan. I chose this location due to the small class sizes, but in my last workout with them, he didn't even demo the exercises. How very dangerous! I thought I'd get more attention than a traditional Bootcamp, not less. I won't be returning. The other FBBCs in the area get much higher praise for variety in workouts at the same price!\n",

      "       A brand new modern dental office that stays on top of technological advances in both the dental equipment used and appointment reminder tools. I've been with Riverside Dental since they first opened and have felt that they were genuine dentists with high integrity. They do not try to up sell you on services that you don't need. The staff are always professional and thorough. Did I mention that they offer a free teeth whitening kit for all new patients? And if you refer enough friends and family (think the magic number is 10) you can earn yourself a free electric toothbrush. My previous dentist suggested having all of my old fillings removed to be replaced with new ones, and I was a little skeptical of whether it was needed. Riverside Dental is keeping a close eye on my filling through regular x-rays and suggested that it is okay for me to keep my old fillings as long as they are monitored. When I go in for my regular teeth cleanings, they make sure that the dentist comes to check my teeth at least once a year to make sure everything is in order. I love that they take a digital photo of my teeth before cleaning and after cleaning; it is such a great reminder of why teeth cleaning is important. Their admin staff is actually one of the key reasons why they get 5 stars. I can tell that the dentist and owner really appreciates his admin staff, and rightfully so because they are amazing. They smoothly process all of my insurance claims electronically and was nice enough to read through my insurance plan to make sure that I make the most of it. I realized that I can be covered for more than just 2 teeth cleanings per year. Their e-mail reminders are way more friendly than your typical voicemail, or a little card with a date on it. Tip: There is free parking on the smaller side streets behind the dental office. You can come in early and enjoy their beautiful waiting room with free beverages.\n",

I am not suggesting they don't exist, but where the dentists proved good, service/availability/rates usually proved equally disastrous. Riverside Dental is the exception. I adore Dr. Arin, one of a kind, best-kept-secret dentist; Really appreciate the email reminders; Repeatedly amazed by price and payment flexibility; No sale gimmicks, just good ol'... quality oral... health. Duh. I RECOMMEND: asking lots of questions about the free whitening for first time customers. It's a personalized take-home kit so a bit tricky.

      "       Riverside dental is really really great. I HATE going to the dentist. I hate it so much, I havent's been for 10 years. But one of my friends recently decided to get braces and we started talking about teeth so much that I started feeling bad about mine and decided to go and check things out to make sure everything was ok. Plus a whitening was definitely becoming a must. I checked another place in Leslieville but I didn't love the service at the front. The girl barely new the prices, she seemed like she knew nothing about dentistry and I left not convinced and without an appointment. Then I entered Riverside Dental. I loved the atmosphere right away. Two thumbs up for the girl at the front (she was training another really nice girl), she was so knowledgeable and nice, and knew exactly what i needed to hear to make me feel confortable. I came back a week later for an appointment. What really sold me was that for the first exam you have there, they do Xrays, photos, full consult and they give you a free teeth whitening kit for half the price of most other dental clinics. So yeah their first timer package is really enticing. Dr Arin owns the clinic and for now he's alone there with a couple hygienists. I have no doubt they will grow soon. He's a great caring professional and really put me at ease. The Hygienist I saw for my cleanings is the sweetest, greatest person. The service being as uncomfortable as it is, I almost enjoyed it because she was so nice. So for me there is no question. If you need a new dentist, now you know where to go.\n",

You never have to wait for your appointment, they're always ready for you upon arrival. They have state of the art equipment which includes a computer monitor in the room which shows you your entire dental chart and they take before and after photos and show you the work they've done, it's very impressive. The receptionist is very professional, friendly, sincere and welcoming and always works with your schedule. The hygienists are top of the line, I've never experienced discomfort or pain of any sort and they're great at keeping you informed of the procedure. Dr. Ratavosi is completely devoted to the health of my teeth. He's informative, friendly and extremely attentive. His work is superb and he always consults with you before and after the appointment. I feel completely at ease and would highly recommend them to everyone. I rate this office a 5 plus.\n",

      "       Good prices, better laid out than my nearest No Frills at Jane/Lawrence. Still, someone needs to tell these guys it's not smart to block the aisles with skids piled up to the ceiling, nor is it the greatest idea to decide to re-stock the shelves and block the aisles with MORE piled up skids while the customers are trying to shop. If said customer politely asks you if she can get by with her cart, you do NOT tell her, \"Oh, you can go around!\" STOCK FIRST, customers last. Safety? What's that? Might someone get hurt in a store blocked everywhere like this? NAAAAH :P That was the soft drinks aisle, today. I should have walked out. But like the meek polite Torontonian I am, I awkwardly walked around the obstacles and the stock boys and bought my cases of pop. And this is one of the BETTER No Frills stores!\n",

      "       I find it exciting to check out different grocery stores. I had to pick up something at a client's office at Black Creek/Eglinton yesterday and then was going to get groceries. I usually go to Peter's No Frills (Lansdowne/Dundas) but thought I'd check out Ross' since I was in the area. From the outside, it looks HUGE ... but it's really cramped inside. There are many aisles and two carts can barely pass each other. The selection of stuff wasn't as large as Peter's (I ended up stopping there afterwards to get protein powder and Advil). There were 15 checkouts and they were all open ... and there were huge line-ups. I waited about 10 minutes in line. Looking around at the cashiers, I could see that they were soooo not engaged or happy with their jobs ... and it was painfully obvious. I won't be back.\n",

The attending physician in the ER didn't do any labs, pronounced her \"constipated\" and promptly sent her home. The next morning she was in a coma due to renal failure and was hospitalized. Because she was so far gone, she had to live her remaining 6 years with no memory, no cognitive function, a concomitant broken hip and hip replacement, and severely diminished quality of life. Doctors are known for being ageist, especially when the elderly are admitted alone, but I want RVHS to know they ruined a perfectly great life and I'm so sad over this.\n",

      "       Where do I begin ? I have had a few bad experiences at this hospital . 1# when I was pregnant with twins . I had just recently lost one twin and was bleeding and in pain so went to the hospital . The doctor had ordered an ultrasound to confirm it which I had just came back to the ER room after having it . A nurse that was not in the room when the doctor spoke to me came up to me and told me she was sending me for XRAYS ?? WHat \"?? I told her,\"NO\" .I am not even a nurse and know that pregnant women do not go for XRAYS ! She argued with me ...and then the nurse that was in the room with me came up when she heard us . She looked at the paper work and told the other nurse she was reading someone elses folder for me . Their excuse after was that when I went to the xray room the technician would of known you do not give a pregnant woman and xray and then would of looked at the paper work to see I was the wrong patient .! Seriously ??! 2# Being of a very multi cultural background .Both sides of my family are mixed with various ethnicity . Both my parents look Asian as well as my sister and majority of my family members look either Asian, South Asian or white . Well growing up not only have I had to experience comments from people but worse my mother has always treated me very badly . Even telling my nephews he does not have to respect me or pay me back any money he takes from me because black people dont deserve money . Never mind the physical abuse my mom has placed me through all my life and the stuff she has done to my son . Anyways due to the stress I was seeing a therapist who was retiring and refereed me to a dr Kurtz their . This man was upset that I dare say I was South American or of a mixed background . He told me black people are not allowed in South America, anywhere ! Its a white continent ! WTH .according to my birth certificate I am South American ! He said I am clearly not mixed and I am lying . I said to him well you tell me what I am . He crossed his arms in a angry attitude and told me,\" NO ! you tell me what you are because he said he is looking at me and he knows what he sees\" wow ! His name was clearly Jewish . I wanted to ask him how he felt about Hitler because he was clearly no better ! He also asked me my husbands race . Which is Italian ! This made him upset as he felt I did not have the right to marry him! LMAO ...he should tell my husband that ..my husband would have his own opinion to give him ! Anyways he said he did not want to see me again . And that was thew only thing I agreed with him . I did not ever want to see a bigot again either ! And I had to get my own referral from another hospital ! I did advise his department . they made a sad excuse for him and told me to take down my evidence off the internet ..because it would give him a bad name to his peers . SMH Anyways .....despite that He is a therapist he is not an expert in DNA . I KNow alot more about the way DNA works then him . And by the way ...I also have a few family member who are surgeons in the USA who are Harvard graduates not therapist who know that is inappropriate conduct ! And they would not make those remarks because it is not professional to enforce your own personal views . I did by the way get both of my parents to take DNA test !! Yes I am positively their daughter. The dna results from 3 tests show basically the same . I am predominantly actually ASIAN DNA with a quarter being black and the rest European white and YES I am also of MAYAN NATIVE DECENT !!!! I have no respect for this hospital or for the fact they only try to cover up the unprofessional of their staff members\n",

      "       If you want an ER Department known for their great patient care, this is NOT the place. Nursing and Physician staff lack the foundation of providing adequate service to meet the patients needs. If staff are content with just going through the motions then find another job that might make you happier. Let's be clear...people do not go to the hospital for fun or go out of their way to inconvenience staff, they are seeking help and want to be respectfully treated. For example, we didn't know that asking for a blanket was so hard to do. At least the United States has that in spades because if you treat clients like that you get fired. Apparently there is no accountability in social health care, no one to really take the blame because blame can easily be spread around and nothing is done.\n",

We arrived at 8:15am and was told the complete procedure will take 2 hours, and we'll be out by 10:15am. The nurses were very accommodating of the fact my grandma does not speak English, and talked to me instead of everything my grandma had to do to prepare for her CT Scan. They even offered to modify the CT Scan machine so it gives instructions in Cantonese instead of English, which was certainly welcoming for my grandma as I wasn't allowed into the room during the operation. At the end, the procedure was completed at exactly 10:15am. Bonus points for perfect timing, and at the end it actually didn't seem that long of a wait. My only complaint was that the heat was on way too high for me when I was waiting, and I didn't want to take my jacket off as I didn't want to take a chair (it was a full lobby of patients waiting at that time).\n",

All the nurses and support staff are rude and careless. No bedside manners. The cleaning lady came into my moms room which she shred with three other people and yelled at them demanding to know who spilled water in the bathroom, without care that all of them have had very recent surgery. Both ice machines on that floor are broken, this is a floor for people who are having knee and hip surgeries, they need ice! The administration is awful. My mom ordered vegetarian meals and everyday she got non vegetarian and the nurses said there is nothing we can do because all the food comes in in the morning. We ended up bringing her food from home. There is no shower on the floor, They hand you a little tub and some towels and a bar of soap and say sponge yourself. Or they have a waterless skin cleaner. Mom had to stay for five days after her operation and she couldn't shower. How hygenic is that?\n",

Their level of professionalisim is unmatched by any other health institution in the GTA. I can't say enough good things. They took excellent care of my mother for her colonoscopy this morning.

      "       My admiration and appreciation for Dr. Perozek grows with each new visit. I've been having lots of different problems with my eyes, none serious, but each requiring a visit, and sometimes a follow-up. So I've seen him a lot recently. Last week we discussed an eye surgery that I've been putting off for a few years. It's obvious that Dr. Perozek's concern is more for the patient than for making money. He knows how insane my night owl schedule is, and told me that he'd be happy to do the surgery, but I'd be happier if I had another doctor do it. The reason? I'd have to show up at 6:30 a.m. for him to do it, and then return almost as early the next day for the follow-up. The other guy works much later in the day, sometimes into the evening, and that would be a much better fit for me. He said that would have no problem recommending the other doctor. I've always been pleased by the way the office is run: almost never a wait, no pressure to buy glasses there, and great, competent staff and doctor. At the very beginning I, too, found him a bit aloof, but time has changed that to friendly and personable. And this latest experience has shown me that he is really a mensch.\n",

      "       I was a patient of Dr Perozek for several years. He seemed alright, a bit aloof but healthcare in Las Vegas usually leaves me less than impressed so I didn't think too much of it. Fast forward to my last appointment. I don't think I have ever been treated so rudely. He was training some new staff apparently and spent the entire appointment talking to her, ignoring me, and helping the staff figure out how to use the computer. He spent less than 2 minutes talking to me and looking at my eye problem. I was still asking him questions and he got up and headed out the door! He barely answered me as he left the room and headed to the next room. During the incredibly brief appointment I told him several times that I was on a budget and could he please prescribe cheap generics? He said yeah, he would. When I got to the pharmacy later they told me my antibiotics cost $96!!!!!! I had to call back. Luckily they got it sorted out and he prescribed something cheaper but why couldn't he have done that in the first place?! He was so rude I will never go back there. He seems far too busy/distracted to handle any more patients.\n",

      "       I have been bringing my family here for a few years. The office is nice, the staff friendly. I like the fact that you don't get the hard sell on glasses from them. I am pretty easy on my hardware so I try to save some money and just reuse my frames and they have never pressured me to buy the frames from them. I prefer to see an Opthamologist compared to an optometrist as some eye issues run in my family and if I am going to pay the same amount for an exam I would rather have a comprehensive exam done by Dr. Perozek. Dr. Perozek is also a \" nice\" doctor. I see plenty of them and their bedside manner sometimes is quite lacking. Dr. P has never left me feeling like I was just another dollar on his table and spent time explaining options with some eye issues that I have. His staff is also very friendly and remember my kids and I each year when we come in. They are also sensitive to the fact that I hate eye exams as much as dental work and have always been patient with me ( I hate the machines, the lights, and the puffer with a passion ) I have had in the past at an optometrist a tech get upset with me because I couldn't handle being in the device and they tried to hold my head in place. Needless to say I left and never went back. This office however has made my yearly exam a breeze and I don't fear getting in the chair for the exam.\n",

The doctor even made a snide remark as he left the exam room with his assistant. To make matters worse, I had asked for my vision prescription as they had performed (and charged for) refraction, and I would have left the office without it had I not demanded at the receptionist that I receive it before paying. My overall experience is that this doctor is more interested in shuffling patients through the office and offering standard treatment plans. He is not there to deal with patients who are assertive or have questions, and in that case, the visit is over when he is finished with you, not when you are satisfied.\n",

      "       This my eye doctor! I've seen him annually now for a few years, refered by my primary doctor. The office is convientant and close enough to my house, so when they put the drops in to dilate, I don't have that far to drive home, although I get a complinary disposable shades to slip in my glasses to help protect my eyes on the drive home. From the reminder postcard they send me to tell me it's time to set up my appointment, to the office staff, everyone is really friendly and helpful. Today, my appointment was quick, I walked in, signed in sat down and was called back right away, after the eye exam for my prescription, I got eye pressure checked and then dilation. I sat back down in the waiting area, cracked open my book to start reading and didn't get far before I was called back in for the doctor to do the vascular exam! Everything was good. I come back in a year, so from start to finish, I was there a total of 25 minutes! Great job everyone! If you want to fill your prescription they have a great selection of frames, including all the popular designers, even sunglasses. So you can get it all here in one stop. Good staff, great timing, coutesous and quick. Doctor is great with the encouragement keeping my eyes healthy.\n",

Dry eye, comeback again and another charge. And is the only doctor I ever hear to see you only if you have two insurances. I will name him the terminator of our pocket and health system.

      "       I like this place and plan to go back next year. But this is a sincere review, meant to be useful, and there was one thing that really bothered me (it's explained at the end). Yes, the office is swanky, especially the optical shop, as a prior reviewer noted. But don't let this put you off. And yes, there's a bit of a \"sell\". It's not aggressive, but it was strange that I would be encouraged to look at frames before my exam was over (while my eyes were dilating). I declined, saying I'd wait for the results of the exam and was not pressured at all. The optical shop is beautiful and the optician is very friendly. If you're ordering contact lenses, the price is about what it is everywhere else. A little strange to see cosmetic services offered, but it did get me thinking that If I ever do get my eyebrows \"done\" it will be there. The actual exam was fine - and quick! The person who checked my correction and tested for glaucoma before the Dr. came in was very efficient. I would have said the whole thing was rushed, but that's only in contrast to the exam process at UC Berkeley's Meredith Morgan Eye Center, where I've been a patient for about 12 years and which is a teaching facility, so I'm used to being examined first and very very very cautiously by a 4th year Optom student and then having the supervising physician come in to check the student's work. Dr. Perozek himself is efficient, competent and thorough. Right away he noticed something out of the ordinary and at the end of my appointment, he referred me to an endocrinologist to have my thyroid checked. At first I thought he did so based on my chubbiness, and was ready to explain that I really just eat too damn much, but then remembered someone in the past saying that big, um, protruding eyes can be a sign of a thyroid condition. I mean, I'm not Marty Feldman or anything, but the man's got a point. I should check it, if only to rule out problems. My appointment's later today. Trying not to think about it... Back to the actual review: Overall, good experience. Kudos to Dr. Perozek for having a \"good eye\" re: my \"Betty Davis eyes\" and being stern in his encouragement to use eye drops to supplement my substandard tear production. He didn't over-explain things to me. Very professional. So why not 5 stars? Well, because I'm sad about something. At the end of the exam, when I went over to the sink to put my contact lenses back in, I saw the green intake questionnaire I'd filled out at the beginning of my appointment - in the trashcan! I can understand that a physician may not refer to it during an appointment (or even read it at all), but why have us fill them out only to discard them? And more importantly - why not shred it!? This is a question of confidentiality as well!! The questions were good ones and addressing even one of them with a patient on his or her first visit would be a good way to build rapport (and clientele). I recommend either putting the questionnaires to use (someone spent a lot of time creating them!), eliminating them altogether or shredding them at the end of the day, after those sensitive soul patients have left :)\n",

      "       I went to Dr. Perozek's office and was dissatisfied with the service. I originally went in to see the doctor due to blurry vision and redness/burning in my eyes. In my opinion, the exam was not thorough and the assistant that took down all my information and complaints was diagnosing me herself. I was dismissed rather quickly after seeing the doctor and was given a new eye glass prescription to correct my vision. I felt uncomfortable and was treated as if his next appointment was more important. Later, after going to a different ophthalmologist, I found out that my additional concerns of redness and burning in my eyes were causing my blurry vision. It was not just a simple -- here you go your new prescription so you can see better. Forget the underlying factor of trying to figure out why my eyes were burning or red all the time. I will not return to this office nor will I recommend him to any of my friends or family. I have also advised my primary care physician of my experience and recommend that she should not send anyone else to Dr. Perozek's office.\n",

I asked how much it would be to get cataract surgery done for my mom who was visiting from Germany (she is somewhat not trusting with the doctors she had seen in Germany). Of course I already had a ball park in my head and he was spot on. He then asked how my mom's health insurance situation back in Germany is. When he knew that she was covered, he said, why not do it at home and save the money (he did not knew that my mom wasn't thrilled about the ophtalmologists she had been seeing in Germany)? Given how much he could have made (which is several thousand) I can only say thank you Dr. Timothy. Those are the doctors that I would keep recommending to others!\n",

She was supposed to call me back on Monday, never did. I had to call Tuesday and she asks me oh did you get your blood work done? No I said, I'm waiting for you to get back with me with the answers to my questions. She asked if I was coming in for my appointment tomorrow and I said no, on Friday we said we would get that rescheduled since I did not have my blood work done. I get that office tag may have had something going on personally that effected her absent mindedness however there is still a level of professionalism to be maintained. I was beyond frustrated. I got a call coming in, not sure what happened and we got disconnected....2 days later still no return phone call.

      "       After over 2 years of other doctors and feeling like I was getting nowhere with my health, I made an appointment with Dr. Orona. She spent her time hearing me out and going through all my previous records.She ordered thorough blood work and urine samples, and explained exactly why she was doing certain tests. This was also a good hour appointment, which was refreshing. I was then given a packet of extensive homework to do at home at my pace, in order to further educate her in my symptoms. The follow up appointment was truly productive, more so than the last 3-4 doctors I have seen. We have a game plan and I feel hopeful for the first time in a long while.

      "       We have been seeing Dr. Orona for over a decade. We started out in her practice with a different doctor and I ended up seeing her because he wasn't available. Once I met her I never saw the other doctor again. She is a parent as well and understands the complicated dynamics of humans. She has helped us keep diagnose some severe behavioral issues with our kids and she offered us options instead of stimulants. She doesn't mind weird complex problems and she LISTENS to you. She doesn't say \"well this is how your body should act\" because mine just doesn't act normally. She is patient, listens closely and suggests, instead of demanding I do something. Many times I don't want to do a certain test or I'm resistant to something. She takes the time to find a solution that works for me and my severe allergies. We moved out of state and quite honestly Dr. Orona was a big factor in why we moved back to AZ. She is an amazing doctor. I'm glad she's on the younger side. I am hoping she won't retire anytime soon. If you have Cigna, see her! She is worth the cash to be a cash patient.\n",

      "       Disclaimer: Dr. Orona is my sister, but I'll try to forgive her for that. My girlfriend has suffered from gluten and dairy allergies, and of course she loves breads and cheeses. So when Dr. Orona offered a solution, we stopped in to check it out. Using sophisticated electronics (not needles in the back), Dr. Orona checked her patient against several common allergens and noted a difference between cow milk and goat milk. She also spotted some surprise allergens affecting my girlfriend's body. After screening, Dr. Orona prepared a charged vial used to desensitize her patient to the allergens, then prescribed supplements to aid in digestion. The visit was quick, easy and painless. Weeks after her treatment, my girlfriend reports improved digestion, less sensitivity to gluten and dairy and better overall health.\n",

      "       I started coming to Silver Creek about 5-6 years ago after my tooth cracked and I needed to see a dentist quick and needed one on my insurance. I am so glad I stumbled on this office and Dr. Hargrave. Ever since then, this is my go to dentist for cleanings, checkups, and that occasional problem I might have. I had a crown put on last year and I was shocked at how different (in a good way) my experience was compared to prior dentists. Dr. Hargrave is really good at understanding his patients. If you have concerns he will listen. However, he doesn't waste your time selling you on things you don't need. Checkups are thorough, quick, and honest. I also love the hygienists here. They are very honest with you about what you need to do if your teeth and gums are not 100%...but not rude at all and they don't make you feel bad if maybe you haven't been flossing as much as you should. I also went for cleanings here during the 2.5 years I had braces and they did not require that my wire be removed for cleanings, which was nice. They made sure to tell me what I needed to do in order to ensure my teeth were as healthy and strong as they could be to avoid issues when my braces were off...and low and behold, there were no issues when the braces came off. Highly recommend this dentist. Dentist visits are never FUN but Silver Creek, Dr. Hargrave, and his staff makes it so that you don't dread them.\n",

The front staff is super friendly and Dr. Hargrave is also friendly. Their office is on the other side of town but I would gladly travel any distance just for Dr. Hargrave and his staff. My appointment was at 1 pm and I was promptly called back and the Hygenists and Dr. Hargrave were in the room examing my teeth within minutes and then the Hygenists then started with my 6th month cleaning. Most dentist won't perform a check up and cleaning in the same visit but Dr. Hargrave did both and that is what I love most about his office and the fact that this is a family practice and not a cooperation or a big dental practice. A++++ am going to recommend to all my family and co workers and everyone in general\n",

I had gone to another big name dental practice in March of 2017 that treated me like I was cattle, so meeting the staff here at this dental office was a blessing. The doctor and staff made sure I was comfortable and they were very gentle. I would recommend this office to any person who asked about a great dentist office and they'd be worth a drive from across town for people who don't live close by. I can't wait for my next cleaning in 6 months. Thank you staff and Doctor for making me excited to get my teeth cleaned.\n",

      "       Dr. Hargrave and his staff is pretty awesome. I haven't been to a dentist in about three years due to not having insurance. I haven't been taking good care of my teeth. After taking X-rays of my teeth, the dental assistant took digital photos to show me the tartar build up. Dr. Hargrave came in to talk to me and did a physical exam of my teeth. He was very professional and didn't make me feel uncomfortable or ashamed of not taking care of my teeth. He said I did have some gum issues which I kind of knew already. He explained to me that he will have his hygienist come and talk to me once she was ready. He had me wait outside in the waiting room until Teresa was ready. Teresa explained to me that I would need deep cleaning and what was involved in the process. She also measured my gum pockets. I'm not quite sure if it is the right medical term. She let me know that usually three millimeters is good once they get to 6 or more the bacteria is underneath your gums where you can't floss and you start getting gingivitis plus other gum disease. That is where the deep cleaning comes in to cleans underneath the gums and get rid of the bacteria so the gums can heal. I would definitely recommend Dr. Hargrave at Silver Creek Dental to my family and friends.\n",

      "       I had a comprehensive exam, fmx and prophy done. I expressed my concerns with my dental health and with dental care I have received. Dr. Hargrave did not acknowledge my concerns. I had a crown replaced in October to utilize my remaining dental benefit. Now, 1 yr later I have been to another dentist who did perio probing and gave me numbers that were significantly different than the numbers taken by Dr. Hargrave and his hygienist. I do not believe they are very competent at what they do. (when I say significant I mean he gave me numbers maintainable like 2's, 3's maybe a 4 or 5 but now I have 12 and 9... don't think that happened in 1yr) I had to return and have the crown recemented in after it just fell out 1week after seating... they do not clean nor etch the prep/build-up area after taking the temp out and before final cementation....so...for 3wks this area has been collecting muck and they just have an assistant slap the final in.... They also bill for build-up automatically even thought there wasn't any build-up done. I couldn't, and still can't, chew on that restoration, but won't return. Dr. Hargrave's solution to adjusting my bite was to grind down the opposite crown (also a restoration...jeopardizing the integrity of that restoration) instead of addressing his own work. In retrospect I am additionally peeved that they had gone ahead with placing a crown and billing me and my insurance on a tooth that has compromised bone health. If your approach to dental care is like the 3 monkeys, Dr. Hargrave is your way to go... but if you want enlightened competent care... find somewhere else (and let me know who you found...)\n",

But he is also mine &amp; my parents dentist too ahaha I initially found him through insurance 2 years ago &amp; am so glad I picked him! Previous to seeing him I hadn't seen a dentist in years (sad to say) because I didn't have dental insurance but I was having tooth pain so I scheduled an appointment. I ended up needing 4 emergency root canals But him &amp; his office did what they needed to with my teeth and referred me to a specialist. As a child I had traumatic experiences with dentists but he gave me my hope again! Ahah After all my teeth were fixed I felt so much better and can eat on BOTH sides of my mouth again. After that I referred my parents then switched my kids over to Silvercreek! Anyone who needs a new dentist, try him out!\n",

      "       We have been to several dentist offices in town over the years and we highly recommend Silver Creek Dental. My daughter was told by another dental office she needed 9 fillings along with a dental procedure that wasn't covered by insurance. The total out of pocket would have been over $1,000. Dr. Hargrave checked her and found one cavity, that he took care during our visit for a total of $53. The additional procedure wasn't even necessary, saving another $125. I am very grateful for Silver Creek being so efficient, professional and trustworthy.\n",

      "       0 stars for the fillings done on my teeth. I had to see this dentist as he was the only one close by that was covered by my insurance that wasn't a complete horror shop. The place is pretty nice looking but I'm not a fan of the dental work. I have received ALOT of fillings in my life and this was definitely not a good experience. Dr. Hargrave started numbing my mouth and 2 mins later begins drilling my tooth and it's not long before I feel pain and nearly jump out of the seat. Never in my life have I met a dentist that doesn't allow at least 10 minutes for the numbing to take effect. So after we wait a bit he begins the procedure. The entire time he is resting the tools he uses on the corner of my mouth while working. I don't feel it at the time because I am numb on that side but when I got home I noticed a red cut in the corner of my mouth. How unprofessional. I come back a few weeks later for the second filling and he over does it on the numbing this time and the entire side of my face is numb! My eye nose and back of my throat feel like one giant fat lip! At least I didn't experience any pain during procedure this time but my face remained numb for many hours afterwards. The next morning I go to floss my teeth and realize I cannot floss my new filling! There is an excess amount of residue in between my tooth and prevented my floss from reaching the gums! So irritating. I also had another red mark in the corner of my mouth from him resting the tools there during the procedure. I called and asked if I could come in for him to fix this filling and they cannot see me for another week. So I can't floss this tooth for a week? I decide to never go back there again and everyday for the next few days I try to force floss past the teeth next to the new filling in an effort to fix the problem myself. Finally after a few days I'm able to break through and floss that tooth again. A few months later I receive a bill in the mail stating that my insurance didn't cover my x-rays and part of the fillings....are you kidding me?! I'm never going back to this dental office.\n",

      "       -5 if I could. I decided to come to this dentist because is right next to my job and also because the ratings seem so stunning.... But little did I know they became the worst dentist experience in my entire life. I can not express the stress, pain, time and money this people have made me waste. 1. I go in for fillings I had already been quoted and was told it wouldn't change. Go in and the price goes up about $150 dollars more. Ok. Fine I can deal with that since they had to work more on one of the fillings, after done was re assure by Dr. Hargrave main dentist that he was able to get it fill so I do not need a root canal or anything. Ok thanks doc! 2. After getting my fillings done about 4 days still hurts and can not eat anything from my right side(still can't) Ok.. Go in the office again let me remind you is right next door to my job they know us very well. So I made an appointment to be seen because as the front desk girl I think Alejandra is her name short black and blonde hair, she stated that is not normal for me not to be able to eat that there should be little pain ( I understand that) but the eating part no Bueno, so later on that day i get a call that they doctor won't be able to see me because is his birthday so he won't be in a full day... Ok i guess my only choice rescheduled Ok... 3. so I wait and wait because the only appointment was about a week away. And let me say this is a week already passed since I got the fillings and I've been in excruciating pain and they're very well aware off. The one day before my appointment finally !! But wait the oh! so lovely nurse (with a sarcastic voice) walked into my job again right next to their office. She asks... Are you still in pain? (Hmm yea I'm still in pain) she than tells me ok so we can't see you tomorrow because you actually need a root canal as she slides over my desk a referral card.... I was shocked and let her know how stupid it is for them to had know this for about 2 weeks and that I've been telling them I'm in pain and than the day before my appointment they decided that they could not see me and I needed a root canal! Well thanks so Fu***** much as***** for making me wait knowing I'm in pain and than telling me I now need a root canal when Dr. Hargrave had re assure I didn't need. She saids they knew that since my first visit I needed one!!!!! F*** Y** I will never come back here. They suck as a professional dental office. They need to let patients know when they need something right away not 2 weeks after being in pain. Knowing I was next door they could have taking the extra 5 steps and let me know what's going on or give me a damn call they were quick to cancel my appointments but to let me know about what I need. No let's wait they said.. I'm not a doctor that's why I rely on them. But now no thanks they are a horrible establishment when it comes to let their patients know what they need in a TIMELY MANNER!!!\n",

This was my first dental exam since 2009 and I was greeted very warmly as soon as I walked in!! The lobby area was very clean, modern and had a great feel!! I instantly felt like this appointment was going to be a good one! Roberta was so kind and very talkative, and made me feel very comfortable as soon as I sat in the chair! She was professional yet very personable as well! Two big thumbs up!! Dr. Hargrave was just as amazing! He did a great job and made me feel right at home!

      "       Honestly, I never understood why people are so apprehensive of going to see a dentist. Over the past decade, Dr. Hargrave and his staff have helped me protect my teeth while treating me as if I was apart of their family. Friendly, sociable, and efficient, I've always enjoyed my visits to the office. Whenever I enter, I am greeted by name by the staff and asked how I have been. I'm not sure if they keep extensive records on their clients, but the amount of personal information the staff is able to remember makes for an excellent customer service experience. Besides the regular cleanings and fillings, Dr. Hargrave also provides a wide range of other dental services. I've have always had great experiences at Silver Creek Family Dental; and I would, without a doubt, recommend Dr. Hargrave to my friends and family. Actually, while it's not a criticism, but I do have a minor observation. Dr. Hargrave schedule's is always booked weeks in advance. While I am sometimes upset that I can't get seen right away, I understand there's very little the staff can do to about it. With excellent service, I would expect for the office to be busy!\n",

      "       It has taken me some time to write this because of the emotional roller coaster I've been on. My 19 y.o. was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and it has widely spread to her lymph nodes. (Dr Nasri removed 39 and 20 came back positive for cancer). I want to write so much! but I'll spare y'all my long story and get to the part that matters to yelp. She was stage 4. One of the lymph nodes was sitting on her Vagas nerve. 20 of them up and down her vocal cords. The scar should have been atrocious, but it isn't. She could've lost her voice, but she didn't. She could've lost movement in her right shoulder. Dr Nasri performed a 6 hour long surgery, kept her nerves intact, preserved her vocal cords, didn't have to sever her jugular. I've seen other peoples scar from \"simple\" thyroidectomy and my baby girls scar is \"prettier\". I count my blessings that my daughter was referred to him!! I don't have words to describe the gratefulness my daughter, my family, and I have towards Dr Nasri. I'll never be able to repay him. He will forever be in my prayers to bless. Dr. Nasri doesn't just cut you open, he is precise with the knife and consciousness that you will have to live with the scar. My hope for him is that God continues to bless his hands and his talent so that he may-in turn- continue to practice and save lives, vocal cords, jugulars, etc!\n",

      "       For now I'm giving 3 stars. I read all of the bad reviews about waiting for so long, but with all the paperwork at front office, then the nurse in back, they kept me busy enough not to feel like I had been waiting long. I agree with other patients that all of the framed accolades in waiting room are a bit much! I worked for Drs for many years. And if they were voted best doc, the one from the previous year would be taken down, and the new one would be tastefully places between paintings or by itself where you noticed it, but it didn't jump out and say \"LOOK AT ME!!\". So then I meet the Dr. His nurse was typing what he said. His bedside manner was maybe 20%. However, I know he ordered the correct tests to be done. But he could have smiled just a little bit! He really didn't talk to me except to show me how to properly use a nasal spray and why he's ordering said test . So if he gets better on bedside manner next visit, and he actually helps my problem, I will change my review!\n",

In a couple of hours I was having a meal and I was ok to swallow my food. My scar is tiny and hardly noticeable. Dr Sina gives advice on how to protect and help the wound heal perfect. Dr. Sina Deserves every recognition As a companionate, caring, attention to detail, informative, sharp, efficient best quality of care Dr. you can have for your specific medical issue. Any Dr. You have to wait for is worth waiting for because that only shows how he gives personalized care for each patient and if you want a fast Dr. That comes in and out of the room and doesn't pay attention to your needs as a patient then good luck somewhere else because Dr. Sina loves what he does that's why he takes great care of patients!!!\n",

      "       Dr. Nasri knows his shit. Excuse my language...but that he does. His office is filled with his diplomas and awards and it's definitely reassuring when you are going to have your throat cut open. By the time my paperwork from my specialist got sent to Dr. Nasri, I had done my homework. It's amazing how many of my friends had Dr. Nasri perform their total thyroidectomy. When my endocrinologist said that he is the best, he seriously is. By the time I got my appointment scheduled, it was about a month out. When we arrived for the first appointment the waiting room was full. I ended up waiting for him for about 2 hours just to talk about the procedure. We went through my two options/ hemi thyroidectomy or a total thyroidectomy. I opted for the total knowing that it was possible I had cancer on both sides. He had a long discussion about the pros and cons of both. I got my pre op paperwork and was told to get it done before the surgery date. Did that and I met with him right before the surgery to discuss cost and logistics. I waited about 2 hours again for this to happen. I met him at Summerlin Hospital and he was on time for the surgery. Afterwards, he met with my husband and told him his findings but of course we had to wait for the biopsy report. I remember coming out of post op and a few nurses commented on how it was definitely Dr. Nasri's work since I didn't look like Frankenstein. He's good at what he does and the nurses know that. He ended up releasing me the next day super early in the am. I had a post op appt a week later and since it was early in the morning the wait was minimal. Overall, the wait can be long (but the wait is long anywhere I go for specialists) but it's worth it to get the best. My scar is small and he does answer all your concerns.\n",

      "       Dr. Nasri is one of the best doctors I've ever had the opportunity to get service from. When you walk into his lobby, you'll see countless accolades on display. It's very clear he's earned them. He's always pleasant, informative, and direct about what needs to be done to improve whatever ENT condition you're experiencing. He doesn't mince words, which is something I really appreciate in getting clear direction and diagnoses. He's performed two surgeries on me, one to fix my deviated septum and also clear out a bunch of extra tissue in my sinuses, and the other a UPPP to remove my tonsils and other issues that have been greatly excacerbating my sleep apnea. He was supportive and reassuring both before and after my procedures, and they have improved my quality of life exponentionally. There were some issues with his staff in the past, but those are no longer a problem as any interactions I've had since my initial visits two years ago have always been pleasant and helpful. I would highly, highly recommend that you book any of your appointments as early in the morning as possible. He books a lot of patients, and if you have any appointments after 9am, expect a long wait beyond your scheduled appointment time. Regardless, the wait is worth it.\n",

      "       Dr. Nasri is one of the best doctors in his field. You can tell he knows his discipline and has in depth knowledge and expertise when it comes to ENT matters. I have been seeing Dr. Nasri for many years for rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. He performed nasal surgery on me in 2009 that was successful and improved many of my symptoms. I would highly recommend him to anyone with an ENT concern and it is my understanding that he is highly regarded by other doctors in the field here in Las Vegas. He is a little vain, but can be excused for it given the results he provides. Nonentheless, I do share some of the same concerns as the other reviewers here; namely, the office staff IS rude and the wait times demonstrate a complete lack of respect for the patients time. Dr. Nasri was once heard telling a patient who complained of the excessive wait time to see him: \"If you want the best steak in town, you would have a wait too\" What he doesn't understand is that any high end restaurant that accepts a reservation for a certain time, and then blatantly disregards the reservation time and subjects the customer to rude service staff, will eventually lose business as a result; because after all, there are many good places where one can enjoy a fine steak without the wait and unpleasantries...\n",

      "       So the reason I went to this Doctor is because I saw great reviews for him online. I was having breathing issues being that my nostrils would alternate swelling, causing me to only breath out of one nostril all day and night. When I go to his office I noticed a lot of rewards and recognitions so that led me to believe his reviews online were valid. I got a really bad impression from the front desk ladies. They weren't very eager to help or friendly but I made an appointment anyway. When the Doctor first saw me he spent around 10 minutes diagnosing me and told me right away I had a deviated septum and needed surgery. He was very short and spoke to me like if I was Doctor and able to understand his medical terms. So I trusted his decision and followed through with the surgery. For my second appointment he also spent less than 10 minutes explaining to me what as going to happen and not to mention his assistant was very short and made a mistake by writing down the incorrect procedure for me (luckily he caught it). So while I sat in the waiting room I noticed he just bounced around from patient to patient not even spending much time or explaining the procedures. After the surgery I came back for the last appointment and he said everything came out ok. I followed all his steps and medication and about a week later the same issue continued. It's been about 9 months since the survey and since then I still have the same problem and I've actually learned that other people have had the (deviated septum surgery) for the same problem as me and it does not fix the problem! I feel like that office just wants to get people in and out and cash in. I waited this long to write the review because I thought my nasal issues would get better but they never did.\n",

      "       Dr. Nasri is an excellent physician but every time I go there (3 times now) I have waited over 2 hours to see him. The receptionists just say \"this office always runs late\". I know he goes to patients surgeries and emergency situations and works many 12 hour days, but appointments are way overbooked!!!! They need to book less people so they are not always 2 hours behind. I even waited an hour and a half for a 7 am appointment. How is that even possible when they saw their first patient at 6:30? The wait is worse than the DMV!!! The secretaries have no clue how it effects people's jobs and scheduled commitments. If they had to wait 2 hours at the doctor every time they go maybe they would be more compassionate.\n",

Don't expect to get answers or if so short ones..you are not entitled to ask this dr. He's Got A GOD complex. I had to laugh because in the office are 2 plaques that say he was awarded most compassionate dr. Really??? I'd hate to see the least. After the long wait. ..short exam. .we have no answers.

      "       I'm glad to see that my experience was atypical; however, of all medical experiences I've had in my life my experience with Dr. Nasri and his staff is one of the worst. I cannot attest to Dr. Nasri's medical proficiency and expertise because, as I will explain I had to stop receiving treatment from him. My first appointment I made was for a consultation for my chronic sinus infections. I made an appointment two-three months prior to seeing him. When I get to his office, which was several minutes before my actual appointment I fill out all the paperwork yadiyada and sat in his waiting room for forty minutes past my scheduled appointment time. I didn't have any plans that day so it wasn't a big deal, but I was forced to sit and look at all of his \"Best Doctors... (of southern nevada, summerlin on tenaya)\" magazine covers that that he was featured in and framed LITERALLY all over the waiting room and in the receptionist's office. When I was finally taken in to the waiting room the nurse with ripped scrubs, exposing the side of her abdomen, (I mention this only to fully demonstrate the lack of professionalism at this facility), sits me down and asks me questions all the normal stuff. I will mention that there was an ENT anatomy poster that was ripped down to make room for more of his self-indulgent, vapid magazine cover awards. Doctor Nasri finally comes in the office about an hour and a half past my scheduled appointment time. He comes in, examines me, and multiple times throughout the examination, the nurses walk in to the room without knocking and come in and chit chat and grab paperwork since I guess they use patient room's to store files (?) idk, it was just a violation of typical patient privacy and a deviation from the normal professionalism you expect at a reputable medical facility. I was scheduled to see him back a few weeks later. My appointment was at 3:30 and I had work at 5 and I had already spoken to my manager about my doctor's appointment so if my appointment took a little big longer I would be ok. Because of how long it took my previous time I called an hour before my appointment to see if they were running on time. The receptionist told me that \"they have 7 people waiting and 8 people just checked in\" and so I asked when I could be seen and explained my situation she told me that \"Dr. Nasri's office always runs late\" flippantly. I ask her if I'll be seen at my scheduled time and she retorts \"his office always runs behind, you don't need to be rude to me.\" I asked to cancel my appointment as I can't be seen at my scheduled time and have to go to work and she tells me that I will be charged a cancellation fee of $25. How does this make any sense considering that I wasn't going to be to be seen at my scheduled time, or any where near that scheduled time, and had later obligations? I wasn't canceling my appointment for 3:30, I was canceling my appointment for a vague time around 5:00 PM. May I remind you I made an appointment for 3:30 and was told I wouldn't be seen at least an hour after my scheduled time, so I was NOT canceling my appointment at 3:30, I was simply unable to accommodate their lack of time management. She starts spouting at me that his office always runs late and its in my patient contract that I pay the fee. Nonetheless, this facility is one of the least professional I have ever encountered. Don't let the embarrassingly self-indulgent and utterly useless \"best doctors\" framed magazines mounted over every square inch of his facility lead you to believe otherwise.\n",

      "       Dr Nasri and his staff have been amazing. I was referred to him after an endocrinologist determined I needed to have my thyroid taken out. He accurately diagnosed my Hashimoto's after I had been misdiagnosed for over 15 years. He kept my scar extremely small even though my thyroid was huge. A year later, he performed a sinus surgery and as he promised it has greatly improved my quality of life. Have I waited in the office to see him? Absolutely. Is it frustrating to wait to see a doctor? Absolutely. After the many dealings I have had with Dr Nasri and his staff, I would go back again and again. He is one of the best doctors in town and the best are busy. If you are looking for a skilled doctor who has excellent bedside manner, this is the guy. If you are looking to not spend too much time in the waiting room, shoot for an appointment early in the morning. But just in case, bring something to read and remember, the best are worth the wait.\n",

      "       I love the mission of 6 Degrees. It's a friendly and affordable place to receive acupuncture treatments from licensed and experienced practioners. They use single-use, disposable, sterile needles. When I went to 6 degrees, I was a bit nervous because of the community setting. However, Lamia was very personable and made me feel right at ease. Due to my chronic issue, I was not expecting for a cure on the first visit, but wow, I did experience a temporary benefit after the first visit. I know that it will take several visits to address the issue along with other modifications. I also have received multiple acupuncture treatments at the Naturopathic School and Physiotherapy clinic, but never experienced any benefit like the one I had at 6 Degrees. I also saw a Hong Kong trained acupuncturist in the past in Scarborough, but on the first visit, he refused to treat me with acupuncture because my condition was too \"severe to benefit from acupuncture on the first visit\" and charged me $132 for a week of herbs. He expected me to pay and be on the herbs for a few weeks before he would treat me. it was very unaffordable, so I could not go back. Based on my experiences with acupuncture, I am definitely going back to 6 Degrees.\n",

The girls at the front desk were nice volunteers. They explained us the system and rates. You fill in a paper with your name, your practitioner's name, the amount payed, and the date. Then you put the money in an envelope and place it inside a box. There is a $15 charge for first timers evaluation. I was treated by Jen. She was kind, friendly, accurate and fast. After some questions she placed the needles and let me relax in the comfy coach. The acupuncture area was busy: we were 6, however, it was really quiet. Everybody was taking a nap and were considered when leaving (silently). I felted comfortable with the vibe. The prices are affordable too, so for sure I'll go back.\n",

You'll find two rooms with several reclining chairs to lay down for your acupuncture session. Even though you have your treatment with others in the same room, the therapists treat you individually. I have been going here for several months due to chronic headaches and was treated by Susanda Yee. I highly recommend her as she is knowledgeable and really takes the time to assess your issues and concerns. I was surprised by the level and quality of care they provide. It is absolutely wonderful and I always feel relieved after each treatment! Come here if you are looking for affordable acupuncture.

This place is for the shopper that wants to grocery shopping and pick up a few essentials with good prices. I hate shopping at Walmart because it is always crowded and is huge. You can spend a whole day in Walmart this place is awesome because it has all your needs in a smaller space. Also I really like the fresh department with salad bar and ready to go meals. It remind me of Whole Foods but not the prices. Merchandising of the store was good and flowed really well. It was setup well for that impulse items while shopping and they had some really nice things. The only thing I was confused was all the makeup was locked up. You had to press a button to get service. I know these items get stolen a lot but when a person is shopping for makeup, you like to pick up the products read and choose which one. I will probably buy my makeup somewhere else. In general it was a pleasant shopping experience and I will be back!\n",

It was way after opening day and the store was slow The deli had all inexperienced workers I actually felt sorry for them The deli was nothing special the Smiths deli on rampart and lake mead is so much nicer The chicken company chicken was rubbery and probably sitting for sometime Ruby cookies were very good but I can't afford a dozen at $2.50 a cookie! Cousins not open inside very disappointing The housewares department was awesome! The produce department was huge and very nice The clothing section was just awkwardly placed inside store and very sparse The seasonal area was just a lot of wasted space with nothing different than any other Smiths in an aisle Overall I felt they had a lot of potential to make it spectacular and it was mediocre\n",

      "       I guess when you think about grocery stores, you think just the basic grocery store that has 18 aisles and your departments. This grocery store isn't an ordinary grocery store, it's a marketplace. Located at sky pointe and the 95, it stands in its own lot, with its smiths gas station of course for that long drive if you live on the other side of town. This store offers a lot, from your basic departments aka produce, bakery, deli, meat etc they have a lot of other choices. It's like a mixture of Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and Winco, with a hint of Costco/Sams club with their clothing section. They do have an area where you can sit down and eat, which is pretty cool cause they put mini self check outs there too, where you can buy your food and enjoy it longer. They also have microwaves to buy their prepackaged meals or frozen meals! They also have a salad bar, Starbucks, a chicken place and cousins Maine lobster (which when I went I didn't know how to order or where, kind of confusing as to if they are open or not.) It's a good store, I heard one is opening up near the M resort. If you are in the area it's nice to shop for where there are endless self checkout machines and 3 registers open.\n",

      "       I'M IN LOVE!! And it may just be because it's new, who knows. But for now, I am in love. The parking lot is ENORMOUS!! It's not crowded (yet). Huge bonus- they offer the ClickList service!! YAY! I have never been to a Smith's Marketplace, so this was all new to me. Right when I walked in I saw a clothing area. Actually, it much reminded me of a Target (my favorite store)! In addition to food, they also have a pool area, pet section, beauty area, toy section, etc. There are so many more choices here, even on regular items such as ice cream flavors and yogurt flavors. You can also get a meal here! They have a couple fast food options, gourmet boxed meals, frozen entrees/sides sold by the pound, etc. This is wonderful if you don't feel like cooking. There is even a little cookie shop. Try the peanut butter fudge one. Delicious!! And of course the bar.. I get the hype, but I'm the kind of person who wants to get her grocery shopping done quickly. Although now I can probably convince my husband to come with me more often. I'll just pick ya up at the bar when I'm done! Grocery shopping isn't as dreadful now.. at least for now. The Smith's is beautiful, and now your one-stop-shop for all your needs. I'll be back!\n",

      "       What a marketplace this is! Seeing all kinds of social media posts, I had to come and check this new Smiths out. A cut above the normal Smiths stores and definitely an adventure coming here. We started out in the produce section which is huge and features both organic and regular produce. There is a whole wall of various types of oats, nuts, granola and you help yourself with their handy bags and scale. Next, we moved onto the meat/deli section but not before we stopped at Ruby Snap cookies for a sample. I had never tasted these cookies before but they did impress especially the Maris which is a brownie type cookie with double chocolate chips and a caramel filling. Definitely one of the most mouth watering cookies I have ever had. Then tried the Penelope which is a combination of peanut butter and chocolate! Again super flavorful! These cookies aren't cheap though. For a half dozen you will pay $13.50. But you won't be disappointed with these cookies! Friendly service at the meat/deli section and right behind this area is the Murray cheese bar with free samples and all kinds of unique cheeses. All they need to do is add a wine bar and grapes! Moving on, we found the mini pub featuring many brands of microbrew and craft beer. Yes, you can sit down at the bar and soak up some duds while shopping for your weekly needs. The beer section is large and I like the fact that they sell many locally brewed beers. From there we finished up our shopping but not without checking out the food choices such as Cousins Maine Lobster, Chicken Co, fresh sushi, and deli sandwiches made to order. There was also a freezer containing Mochi ice cream. Of course they have a Starbucks too. They also sell clothing, shoes, bathbombs(yes!), some outdoor items, make up and their fresh flower section is huge with lots of variety. I would say this store is a little bit Target, and the rest a grocery store. Everyone working was pleasant and helpful. I didn't spend anymore then I normally do when grocery shopping but lots of temptations. In addition, they also have the fuel station and using your reward points can save you some cash on gas these days. I sure hope that they build more of these marketplaces closer to me as the only reason for four stars is this is a bit of a drive for me. I can see returning here though for more Ruby Snap cookies and a chance to try the featured food spots.\n",

      "       They've only been open for a week, and I've been here all but one of those days! Mostly because of the $2 Starbucks grande drink special they were running during their grand opening week. I've noticed the crowds have died down over the days though. Probably because everyone in the city isn't coming by now that the novelty has worn off. We were so excited when we saw the signs announcing that a Smith's Marketplace was under construction here. We had shopped at the St. George location before and thought it was odd that Vegas didn't have one! Just think of a Walmart Supercenter or Super Target minus the furniture and home improvement sections, but more upscale. Aside from groceries, pharmacy, and clothing; this Marketplace also features a beer/wine bar, Cousin's Maine Lobster, Starbucks, Chicken Co. fried chicken, Ruby Snap cookies, Murray Cheese, freshly made sushi, mocha ice cream and a self-serve salad bar. They have plenty of checkout lanes, including dozens of self checkout kiosks. There is even a full seating area near the \"food court\", and self checkout kiosks in front of the seating area in case you'd like to pay and immediately eat your food. Hopefully they will open more Marketplace locations across the valley, since this is the only one so far. I'm sure glad that they picked Skye Canyon though because I'm only one freeway exit away!\n",

      "       This place is MAGNIFICENT. I LOVE how it literally has everything in here. Impressive toys aisle for kids- loved the extensive patio furniture they had to offer. Household items- clothes and shoes seemed like a good quality and reasonably priced. I have NEVER seen a smiths like this - but then again, it's the first of its kind in Vegas so.. I love how everything is appealing to the eye. The lighting in the store - how SO MANY things are behind a display case - with a door and a handle - it makes things so much neater and classy looking (as cheesy as that sounds) I love how it has a Starbucks inside. Something that wasn't offered at my previous Smiths. I Definitely dig the salad bar- as a salad junkie I love the MANY options offered such as different types of lettuce and an endless supply of different toppings. The wing bar is on point!!! Mannnnnn! Those wings were good. You must try the Asian heat flavored ones. Y U M!! Impressive sushi variety at the sushi bar - way more varieties here than I've seen at any other Smith's. There's even a large are to sit down and sip your coffee and/or eat your lunch should you feel like some downtime during your shopping experience. Ummm hellooooo!! How could I forget the bar. The BAR -- inside the store. INSIDE the store. I don't even drink and I'm excited about this ! Hahaha! With snacks like peanuts and pretzels on the bar and an extensive wine and beer menu should you feel so inclined!!! The employees throughout the store were helpful and friendly and there was someone at almost every turn in case you needed assistance. From entrance to exit - this place is simply AMAZING! Hooray for Smith's!\n",

Inside was packed but was able to casually look around with our cart and maneuver around the groups of people who decided to stop &amp; talk (along with their shopping carts) and block aisles. I really don't get when people do this!? Please use common sense and have consideration for others around you. As a regular shopper at Smith's my daughter &amp; I were very impressed with Smith's Marketplace. They have your normal Smith's offerings (with a bigger selection) including a pharmacy and gas station. There is also clothing (for the whole family), household and home decor items, outdoor furniture, bbq grills, etc... There is a Starbucks, Chicken Co., Cousins Maine Lobster, Ruby Snap Fresh Cookies, a salad bar, sushi, sandwiches, bakery, etc... Seating area is available for those who want to dine in. A bar serving beer &amp; wine is also inside. How cool is that?! :) Staff was attentive and helpful. As we were standing in line to check-out, an employee (female) took us to one of the self check-outs to ring us up. She was really nice. The overall vibe reminded us of a popular grocery chain on the East Coast called Wegmans. We will definitely be back and regular shoppers at this location. *Since writing this we have gone back again :)\n",

      "       I went grand opening day around 10 am with all four of my kids and was a pleasant and fun experience! There was a raffle being offered to win $300 grocery money. We first entered and noticed how busy yet clean, fully stocked, and organized everything looked. Very easy to look at products. I loved the floral area and every other area, like the bakery, salad bar area, etc. The kids all received a free balloon, along with free samples all throughout the store, even free lollipops were being given away. I think Smiths should always have free samples of food and items every day. Almost similar to Costco. It is always fun to try new things and then even more fun to buy it when you are surprised with how good it tastes. I was sad I didn't get to try the Ruby Snap cookies. They didn't have any available when I went. I look forward to eating more at The Cousins Maine Lobster. We used the self check out and it went pretty quickly.

      "       Smith's Marketplace just opened today, and although it was kinda packed when we went, there was no problem finding parking or getting a shopping cart. I think the best way to describe it is a mash-up of Smith's, Target, and Walgreens. This place is HUMANGOUS with over 70 aisles of groceries, produce, clothes, housewares, home goods, seasonal items, and everything in between! The best thing to do would probably be to start from one end and work your way to the other end. There is A LOT to see! Aisles are clean, spacious, and well stocked too. I was impressed to see all cosmetics and hard liquor locked up to prevent people with \"Sticky Fingers\" from trying to get a five finger discount! The bakery(donuts) section and the My/Mo self serve mochi ice cream bar proved to be very popular as they were pretty much cleaned out! There's a Starbucks inside, a wine bar, as well as a mini food court with a chicken joint, (don't remember the name) Ruby Snap fresh baked cookies from Utah, and a Cousin's Maine Lobster (inside shop coming soon, food truck outside for now, 11am-8pm) for all you Starbucks diehards...ANY GRANDE SIZED DRINK IS ONLY $2 UNTIL JUNE 19TH!!!! Conveniently located off the US 95 at Skye Canyon Park Drive (Exit 95 off US 95...simple, right?) Hours are 8am-Midnight, and it's a great spot to meet up to fill your gas tank and grab food/snacks before heading up to Mount Charleston for a nice hike! ALOHA!!!

      "       So I went today for the grand opening and it was chaos. The parking lot was full, even hard to find a spot and this place is brand new. There were samples everywhere but also people and lots of confusion too. I really enjoyed the look and feel of this new Smith's Marketplace. It is not 2 stories but rather really high ceilings with skylights everywhere, quite beautiful inside. They have everything inside, food and alcohol with most amenities of other Smith's but there is also home decor, clothing and personal items. A Starbucks is also inside with a large seating area. There is also a gas station adjacent to the marketplace. I did a quick shop for a couple items that were on sale and used self checkout because of how busy it was. I'll be going back when it's calmer after the grand opening celebration is done and update my review but so far 4 stars since I was impressed by how nice it was inside.\n",

      "       I hate this place. I wish I would have never had to come back, but unfortunately it is the closest to my house. Waiting times are atrocious. 4-5-6 hours easily (and I am speaking on at the very least half-dozen emergency, and at least the same number of non-emergency visits to that place!) Not only South Health Campus seems to be consistently understaffed, people working there are generally quite unsupportive and borderline rude. No idea why... Honestly, there must be something in the water that it is so difficult for these folks to at least smile - let alone be kind and friendly! Can't even imagine supportive! Except for maybe... maybe five doctors and nurses we had to deal with in years, all the rest were acting more like farmers dealing with livestock - faceless, cold, harsh, \"professional\", get-in-wait-done-get-out type. This is pretty sad, really - when this hospital was constructed, it looked so modern and beautiful! But oh well.\n",

I wasn't impressed at first with the er but once I got in i was quite impressed. the staff were friendly and kept apologizing about the delay. once upstairs in the short term ward awaiting surgery the staff were very nice. It actually felt like I was talking with friends rather than nurses. The best part of the whole experience was they allowed my dog to come and visit!! the short term ward didn't seem to have visiting hours either as I had a friend show up around 11pm and stayed until 3am without issues. If i have to choose any hospital for anything again I will for sure choose this one. they seem to be more with the times than the other hospitals in the city\n",

      "       Shiny new hospital that you couldn't miss if you tried. It's the biggest building in the Seton/Auburn Bay/Cranston area! How do you get to said area? Drive all the way down Deerfoot South and follow the giant \"H\" and \"HOSPITAL IS HERE\" signs. So fresh, the clipboards are still covered in plastic packaging and the stoplights leading the way aren't in working order yet. The staff here is extremely helpful, the nurses are friendly and happy to assist you in finding which floor you need to be on, and there's no weird hospital-y smell just yet. Parking is roughly $2 every half hour, but I just received amazing news at this hospital, so IDGAF. I'm glad the South Health Campus exists. Pro-tip: If you're not having an emergency and are here for an appointment, don't go to the front. You will block ambulances and people trying to get to the emergency room. Drive around to the back of the hospital and follow the signs for the public parking.\n",

They said they have been trying to call me and my voicemail was full. I politely said that my voicemail was not full, neither did I have any missed calls. They also have my email address. Long story short is that the doctor is out of the office and my flight and hotel are both nonrefundable. So I can't comment on their service or care and judging by the reviews at both of their locations, don't have many happy patients anyway.\n",

He is very ethical in that he will not offer anything that he knows will not work for his patients long term. You will not find any fancy new laser work or duck-like lips on any of his patients. The girls up front have always been so friendly, sweet and helpful. Rachel is the best! She had done my IPL treatments for years and I get nothing but compliments on my skin. If time is an issue I suggest you make an early appointment as I have always done. There is no rushing Dr. Slafko. He is conscientious and caring and takes the time to do his best.

      "       I visited Southwest Dermatology Center, was seen by Dr. Martin Safko. My appointment wait time was about an hour long. One doctor on duty and a room of about 15 people waiting for their appointments as well. Ugh, anyhow you know I don't really care much about age of a Doctor. This visit made me rethink my preferences. This Doctor is up there in age and it was apparent with his dinosaur evaluation. He must be close to blind because he had to put these weird eye goggles on in addition to his two pairs of glasses he already wore. He had the personality of a snail. So once he informs of his diagnosis for treatment he leaves and sends in his front desk staff to eagerly collect my money. Even though I provided my insurance card with insurance that I verified covers my specific treatment and paid my co-pay. The lady is arguing with me in the room about how the doctor won't come back unless I pay first. Wow, this is some bullshit for real! Ok so I get dressed go back out to the front desk to argue some more with these idiots about billing when they are in the wrong. They were not willing to call on my plan to verify the coverage, they were hard headed and in some sort of self righteous attitude. I told them to flip off and that I will go elsewhere. I don't need that Cunty experience, I did not deserve that. This is how they do business, you wait an hour for your appointment, be seen then have to come back out to handle erroneous billing, then you can wait another 20 minutes to go back for whatever you came in for. I wasted 3 hours at this shady and rude office, screwed off a $40 co-pay for nothing and was treated like a shit brick!\n",

      "       I have been a client of SW Eye Institute for many years. The past 3 or so years I have had nothing but problems with their billing department. Through my insurance, my yearly eye exam is free. The past 3 years or more the person that puts in the exam billing code(s) has put in the wrong code(s). Again, this year, when I received my bill there was no insurance payment. I called SW Eye's out of state billing collection department who advised me SW Eye in Vegas put in the wrong code(s). They said they would resubmitted the bill. Let me cut to the quick and say after 9 months of calling SW Eye's out of state billing department they have yet to correct the problem. I have even spoken with a supervisor who said it would be taken care of and someone would call me back. Well, that never happened. They only refer me back to SW EYE in LV. When I call SW Eye in LV I receive a voice mail. After leaving 7 messages with no callbacks, I am tired of the BS with SW and will look elsewhere for my eye exams.

The reception staff was cordial and inviting, my exam was thorough, and Dr. Kim was an absolute breath of fresh air; thoroughly professional, informative, with an incredibly personable and comforting chair-side manner! As for my glasses; for the first time in many, many years, my new Rx was perfect, the frames adjusted spot-on upon arrival, and the value received - priceless!

      "       I went to my appointment today. After sitting in the doctors chair and being in the office for about an hour. One of the workers came in to do another eye exam. She left for a bit then came back and said the doctor that was in the office doesn't do contact lenses and that I would have to come back on Monday to see the other doctor. I said what does this other doctor do that he can't operate the eye machine? What is the point of having him there? I told her to get the doctor. She comes back a few minutes later and says The doctor can't fix my prescription and that I have to wait for the other doctor. I walked into the waiting area furious. I asked her why would she schedule me to come in - when I couldn't be helped? It doesn't make any sense. I asked how often the other doctor comes in - and she said once a month. So if my prescription is wrong again - I have to wait a whole month to get it checked again? I told them I want my money back as I am done wasting my time with these idiots. She has to call the main office to get my money back. Unreal. Do not waste your time going to this office - they are all complete idiots that don't know what they're doing. Funny how they wanted to schedule me for eye surgery when they can't even schedule an eye exam correctly. Steer clear of this place unless you like to waste your time. ***Their office called me today - said they won't refund my money.\n",

      "       I had a very frustrating experience at Southwest Eye Institute. After arriving on-time for my 2:30 scheduled appointment, I waited for 30 minutes before I was seen by the assistant. There was no apology for the wait time. She went through all of the initial tests, then dilated my eyes and said that it would be about 15-20 minutes before the doctor saw me. At this point, although the initial wait was a bit concerning, things seemed to be moving along just fine. Well... little did I know that I would sit in the waiting room, eyes dilated, vision blurry, for almost an HOUR longer!! After I reached the point of frustration, I asked the receptionist how much longer it would be. She said that I was next, and escorted me into the doctor's office. I commented on how long the wait was, and rather than an apology, she merely commented, \"you should have seen it this morning.\" What kind of customer service is that??? After being seated in the doctor's office, I waited for yet ANOTHER 20 minutes until he came in. The remainder of the visit was fine, so I have no complaints about the actual exam- except for the fact that I was there from 2:30pm until 5:15pm!!!! I received my prescription for my eyeglasses, and when I looked at it the next day, I noticed that my name was spelled incorrectly. I called the office, and again- no apology. She just said that when I ordered my glasses, the vendor would call to verify the prescription, so it would be fine. Customer service is obviously not their strong suit.\n",

Sorry James even terrible care is better than no care at all. So I will decline to write you. However every time you go to a Southwest Doctor you are sent a questionnaire asking how your experience at the office that day was. I have filled out every one sent to me with details of just how bad the doctor, nurse and a couple of desk staff were. I have supplied ample information with details. Apparently no one reads and or follows up with the surveys. So don't expect me to supply you with a ay to make my life even worse than a visit with Southwest.\n",

      "       I have been going to southwest for a long time because this is where my insurance is taken and its close to my house . The last time i went in for my back pain I was told that all my tests came up negative and there was no reason for me to be there. After the Dr told me that she started going on about how young girls like me shouldn't be on pain medication and she would never prescribe it to me. i never once asked for pain medication!!! i guess this Dr. didn't realize I have scoliosis and had already been in physical therapy for the past 6 months.(my old doctor retired and this was the one taking her place) When I got very offended and told her I wasn't asking for pain medication, that I had NON-NARCOTIC pain medication at home she got even more aggravated and tried to leave the room before my appointment was over. When I asked about the vaccinations I was also there to get she just walked out. I waited in the room for about 20 min before a nurse noticed me and asked if everything was okay. I had complained about this DR and was told they would call me back in a few days. When I called back a week later they said that my complainant was not on file then tried to hang up on me. My second experience was when I was having breast pain and had scheduled a mammogram. The closest appointment I could get was 3 months away with the OBGNY. When my appointment finally came I was in the waiting room for an hour after my scheduled time. When I finally did get seen, the doctor did a breast exam, he told me that I have lumpy breast tissue. I asked about the mammogram and she said it wasn't her top priority!!!! All I got from her was to stop drinking caffeine for a month and if that didn't work then to try iodine droplets. Now that that hasn't worked I'm waiting another two months for a new appointment that I will demand the mammogram take place. I will not play around with the possibility of breast cancer because the doctor wants to rush out of the room!! When it comes to this place the treatment is so up and down. I have never felt more unconformable and ignored then these two appointments. I'm not really a review writer but once my complaints were \"lost\" iv finally had enough of playing with this place. If you go here stand your ground and don't let them push you around and make you feel like they don't have time for you.\n",

      "       This is one of those places where I felt overwhelmed, stressed, and highly uncomfortable. Waited an hour and did not get what I came in for. I even came in 20 minutes early as requested. The nurse did not call my name until an hour after my appointment. The nurse said \"the way this doctor works is that he has students with him\". They require a Pap smear at this location if you wish to get birth control pills (this information was not explained prior to my appointment). So you expect me to -quote by the nurse- \"FULLY UNDRESS\" with students observing (not to mention the doctor was male and that information was also not conveyed) for a required Pap smear? And then she smiled as if I was suppose to feel comfortable after she said that. No thanks. From prior experience, I know doctors SUGGEST Pap smears but they do not REQUIRE it. I asked if I could get a Pap smear at a different location and bring in the form, they said \"that's not how we work, because you are a new patient\". Well, I called another office and they do not require it (in fact I called several women centers and it was the same response). Some suggestions for this location if the staff and faculty members intend to provide quality care for their patients: 1. Convey important information and Confirm that the patient understands what is needed and required for their appointment. If you require a Pap smear DO LET THEM KNOW. This is not a universal understanding- again, not all locations do this. 2. If there will be students to observe, explain that before you have patients wait for their appointment. Confirm with them if they are comfortable with that and If not, allow them the convenience to see only the doctor. The way this nurse handled this situation seemed as if I had no other choice. Normally, I do not mind students observing, except in this particular situation, it made me feel highly uncomfortable. 3. Develop some empathy and respect for your patients. Let your patients know if their appointment is delayed or will take longer than usual if that is the case. Normally I receive a little courtesy message that lets me know how things are going such as \"just a few minutes the doctor is running late\". As I was in the wait room, I noticed some troubling conversations between patients and staff - all dwindling to a form of miscommunication. I saw \"professional\" staff treat patients as if they were incoherent and seemed disrespectful and rude to patients. It seems this staff has a lot to learn. Overall, I DO NOT recommend this place for women services.\n",

      "       You can see my original message from Nov 25 below. It's December 18, and I have had yet another disappointing encounter with the Associates at 6330 W. Flamingo. When I saw Susan Schuder Nurse Practicioner in October, she gave me a prescription for Chantix. Because they will not give you a paper scrip, I was unaware that the prescription was only for the starter pak, or 30 days of a 90 day program. I filled the prescription, but because of other pending bills, I did not begin taking the medicine until I knew I would be able to afford the second month. It is not covered by insurance, the starter pack was $330, and each of the 2nd and 3rd months is around $290. (I really want to quit). I called the pharmacy to have my 2nd month of the program filled on Sunday, December 13, and was amazed to be told that there was no order for either the 2nd or 3rd month of the Chantix regimen. The pharmacy called and left a message on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday without any response from Ms. Schuder or the doctor, Daniel Malone, who is her supervisor. I called SWMA on Wednesday, 12/16 and again today 12/18, and yet nothing was happening!! The pharmacist called me back to say they were very confused at that office and the person he spoke with was unaware that Chantix is a 3 month program. I finally was put in contact with a Dr. Choe with something called www.nowclinic.com. Never heard of this outfit before, nor am I sure how nowclinic is connected with SWMA, but I am grateful for his intercession, although he did caution me to always contact the now clinic when I am having difficulties with the regular SWMA associates. (Dr. Choe - does this happen often?) The pharmacy I use never has this product in stock (that's why I started 5 days before I was due to run out of medication), and hopefully, my Chantix will be available to pick up Monday, 12/21. BUT MY POINT IS: Why should any patient have to put-up with 4 and a half days of aggravation for health care follow through? Why did no representative of SWMA call me with their questions? I have no answers, I can only posit on the nature of such shoddy treatment. After the issues giving rise to the 11/25 message I left for the Flamingo office, it took a wonderful person called Phylana Thomas from 888 S. Rancho Urgent Care to see my post and to contact me on THANKSGIVING DAY and get me an appointment for some quality healthcare the following day. Please see that review - I cannot tell you how much I appreciated the quality of care I received at that location. Wonderful experience. NOVEMBER 28 EMAIL FROM YELP REPRINTED HERE: No reply yet from Southwest Medical Associates at Flamingo Hi Joyce, You sent a message to Southwest Medical Associates at Flamingo on Nov 25. Just wanted to let you know that we haven't heard anything back from them yet. Bummer! You may want to consider calling them instead: (702) 876-4449 Your original message to Southwest Medical Associates at Flamingo: I am still waiting to be contacted by your staff. You phoned at 3, asked if I could return the call; I did, but was unable to speak to Dr. Malone or his nurse. No one was picking up and the receptionist told me that the calls were not being picked up by voice mail. Questions regarding treatment options that needed to be addressed were not; I am waiting for Dr. Malone or susan to call in a prescription for me. Thank you.\n",

      "       first off, i would like to say I really like my PCP, Susan Schuder. she seems to really care and i trust her. the praise stops there. i went in to see her yesterday for some pain, swelling and grinding in my wrist. she gave me a brace, sent me for xrays and said she would send a referral letter to Steinberg diagnostics right away bc i need an MRI. She told me to call the following morning to make an appt for my MRI. I was on the phone twice with Steinberg and twice with SMA between 7 and 10 am bc the referral letter still hadn't gone through and I was unable to make an appt without knowing what kind of MRI i needed. when I explained to the guy that answered at SMA at 10 am that my Dr. hadn't sent the referral and I wanted to check on the status of it, he snottily told me Susan Schuder was not a doctor, she is an APN, and then proceeded to tell me it can take 5-7 days for a referral to go through. that's fine, but first of all, i don't care about her title, stick to the point, and second of all, she was the one that told me to call the following morning to make my appt! it didn't just make this s**t up, and I don't appreciate being talked to like i'm an idiot.\n",

I'm not a fan of needles and passed out. The nurses got me to a bed and calmed me down. The nurse who took my blood, Cathy, was gentle and understanding and finished quickly.

      "       I couldn't agree more with all the people ahead of me. This place is terrible, from the front desk to the Doctors. First it took me 6 weeks to get my appointment because they had to cancel my first one that I waited 3 weeks for and it would be another 3 weeks wait for that one and then I would not see my primary, the Doctor I saw told me he was doing me a favor my seeing me. I had already been to their Urgent Care and they told me to see my primary. I had a terrible swollen leg and it was inflammed. Dr. walked in and tolded me I needed a Weight reduction clinic, and that would fix it. I take meds that put weight on me have for 20 years, tried to explain that to him, he said my other Dr. was crazy. This Dr. was so rude and nasty, that I left, got his name, and called my insurance company and complained about him. They said they were doing an investigation on him, but who knows. All this place wants is money, they never have any appointments so that you have to go to their Urgent Care which costs much more in co-pays. This place is criminal !!!!\n",

      "       Came in to make sure I was thoroughly over a cold. Decent wait time, had to pay up front. Everything ok to this point. The nurse who walked me in? Cold and completely uncommunicative. Jennifer couldn't be bothered to make a statement in complete sentences, much smile or remove the expression from her face that said I was a waste of time to her. I went in feeling relatively decent, and I was offended. I can't imagine being seriously sick and having this woman as my initial experience at the doctor. When it came to scheduling, Dr. Norris is my primary care provider. I've always had pleasant, through rushed, experiences. To get any kind of appointment that wasn't three weeks out (which is no good for a possible strep), I had to see the PA. No problem. But she came in, looked at my eyes, ears, and throat and said that I probably just had a virus and that there wasn't anything they could do, and walked me to the front. It was pretty much a waste of a copay. Nothing keeps me from going to the doctor more than having this office as primary care! I can't wait to change my insurance options and go back to Dr. Paul Mitchell on Rainbow...that whole place is amazing and the complete opposite of southwest medical.\n",

She didn't acknowledge my aching back whatsoever, and her answer for my rash was \"I've never seen anything like that before.\" Then she left the room and her assistant let me know that I was only getting checked up and I left with no satisfaction. They simply do not care about patients at all. I would rate them no stars if I was allowed to.\n",

Their fresh made products can be a little more expensive then getting the same product from the supermarket but thats the point for making things fresh. The owner is slightly pushy at the end of the day in selling out all his products but thats the point making and selling everything so everyone can have fresh products the next day. If you love and can drink lot of it, it might be a good idea to go at the end of the day to bargin a little, but you might not be able to get everything you want. I like the various types of soy milk that is sold there black sesame, ginger, red dates, original... it's such a long process to make soy milk and soy tofu so everyone should appreciate the art of making it!\n",

I have been a gym member at many different places for decades and never really got much better. Under their guidance I have lost 50 lbs and my lab work is pretty much perfect. I really do believe they had an awful lot to do with my current health. I can't recommend them enough. Their slogan is \"Better Every Day\" and I believe it. Sincerely, Keith\n",

      "       If you are serious about getting results and becoming a better version of yourself, you need to give Spire a shot. It is truly you vs. you each day and the class sizes are limited so you won't get lost in the crowd - they actually notice if you aren't doing things right. During the classes at Spire, Ben and his team consistently push us to grow mentally and physically. They create programs that encourage us to meet our goals and use years of experience and knowledge to steer us down the path we need most. They have even helped my coordination (and really, if you have known me since childhood- this is a downright miracle). One of the most valuable parts of having a scheduled group class is having a tribe that supports, encourages, laughs, celebrates, and grows together. The trainers and people in my classes have become friends (even family) and I look forward to their victories every week - in and out of the gym. In fact, the whole Spire community is pretty awesome. No matter which group you are a part of, there is a great deal of camaraderie when it comes to the Spire crew. My therapy is now lifting heavy things and pushing myself to do things I never imagined this body or this lady would be doing. If you commit to you, so will Spire. If you want results sign up and show up - to Spire and to life.\n",

I had tried different diets with rollercoaster success. Ben put me on a program where I dont have to miss most of my favorite foods. Here is the bottom line. I was tired of skinny people who have never had to lose weight telling me how to do it. The guys at Spire have done it themselves! They understand the struggle and can empathize with what you are going through. This also means they dont put up with your excuses. I have lost almost 50 pounds so far and still going strong.

Both Jesse and Ben have backgrounds in exercise and sports training so they understand common injury patterns. They will work with you on correcting inefficiencies first and moving properly so that you don't run the risk of hurting yourself like you can with other trainers.

What i really love about him is he not only tries to help you achieve your goals (whether its fat loss or muscle building) but he also pays a lot of attention to your posture and the way you move. This has been so helpful for someone like me who spends most of my day on the computer, I've never realized just how much I hunch over or how much my shoulders round forward. He's working with me to fix these problems and strengthen the muscles that have become weak form non use and it's made such a positive change in my back and neck pain. I can't say enough good things about him, so relieved someone recommended him to me.\n",

      "       Spire Health Club is the real deal. At Spire, owner Ben N. has created gym that isn't your typical Globo-Gym scene. Instead, he has a private facility that's full of motivating training, personalized workouts and good people. Before I met Ben, I used to be your typical gym patron: I showed up to random zumba classes, ran on the treadmill, and did what I thought was right to \"get strong\". I had no real path to success because I was clueless as to what tools would really get me the results I craved. However, once I began training with Ben, it all turned around for me. Ben is an incredible motivator and truly knows the grassroots of what it takes to get your body fit, healthy and strong. He goes over it all with you: goals, nutrition...you name it. Under his guidance, I went from being a skinnyfat girl that dangled at the bottom of a bar in an attempt to do a pull up (a fun/embarrassing story for another day), to actually building up the strength and muscle to do pull ups.... and look good doing them! After my 1st unassisted pull-up, I swear I didn't stop smiling for a week!! I was so proud of where I had come in my fitness goals, and Ben was just as excited for me. I 100% recommend checking out what Spire Health Club has to offer you. It has changed my life for the better, and I cannot be more excited to be a patron at such an amazing gym :)\n",

      "       Who doesn't love Sprouts? This store has become one of my favorite spots to come and get my healthy on. From the first step into the store where you're greeted by the beautiful fresh flowers to the fresh produce, deli food area, baked good, frozen foods, vitamins and herbs to their alcohol section, everything is so fresh and inviting. I don't always buy things here, but when I do I usually get their bread and fruit here. Many times they have such great deals on fruit which I can't pass up, even if I don't particularly need it. All their produce looks fresh and free from wilt or bruises. Every time I've been in here, the produce is so nicely stacked as well. Their bread section seems smaller here than other locations, but still have a good selection. But if you're like me and get a particular kind, it can be hard to get what you need at this location. Store is well kept up with shelves stocked, items organized, everything looking clean as well as the restrooms. Employees are nice enough..they don't go out of their way to help, but are helpful when you ask them for help.\n",

The deli counter is another plus...it looks small but Sprout's carries Boars Head products. If you're not on the other side of town at Glazier's \"we carry the full Boars Head line but you gotta wait for an hour to get it\" deli counter, or don't want to deal with a zoo at the nearby Smith's you can come here and find most of your Boars Head favorites at the same prices as Smith's. They also carry a fairly well stocked selection of supplements, vitamins, etc at slightly lower prices than Whole Check charges for the same thing. The staff is knowledgeable too...when I was looking for the ingredients to make \"bulletproof coffee\" they pointed me to a lower cost but just as effective alternative for the base ingredients for the brain fuel component. Checkouts can be a bit slow sometimes. But I always find the staff to be friendly and oh yeah...they know how to smile. Parking is usually not a problem either. Some people may consider this part of town to be \"sketchy\" for various reasons but I don't mind the location at all. If you leave the store hungry you're in luck...Taco y Taco is literally right around the corner and worth a try. 4 Stars...I keep going back week after week and their produce doesn't spoil half as fast as stuff I've purchased elsewhere.\n",

The prices are way better than Whole Foods, though, and they're even better than Trader Joe's because a lot of TJ's organic veggies are pre-packaged. Sprouts also has a good selection of organic, grass-fed meats. Probably better than anybody else because even Whole Foods' butcher shop devotes only a very small percentage to organic/grass-fed. The personal item area with natural vitamins and face wash and stuff is big, but not as big as WF. I can't comment on the quality, though, because I never buy that stuff. Overall, it's my go-to grocery store. I get everything I need for almost as cheap as Smith's, but with a lot more organic/natural.\n",

      "       This store keeps changing (for the worse) so much that it's officially off my list of stores I wll shop at. The final act was them removing the organic bulk section. And the variety of vegan food is maybe 75% less than what it used to be. I will say that the organic fresh produce section is probably the largest of all the local groceries (with the exception of Whole Foods). They carry all the standard produce, but whereas they might have 50 items in the organic section, there are probably 250 in the conventional section. They also seem to be switching over to prepackaged produce (ala Trader Joes) - which is not good if you like picking up everything and examining it like I do. They USED to carry a lot more vegan and organic national brands. No more. Everything seems to be the Sprouts brand now. Not a good thing if you don't buy certain brands (like I do). I can't tell who's making the private label so I won't buy it, In addition, the actual number of choices for each item has been reduced. I see it in the salad dressings, the frozen entrees, the frozen desserts, household cleaners etc. Where they used to carry 4 or 5 different brands, now it's just their Sprouts label and maybe the top 2 national brands. Unlike other grocery stores, in order to get a rain check for an out-of-stock item, the item MUST be advertised in their weekly flyer. If they have a store sale on something that is NOT in the flyer, sorry - you're out of luck.\n",

      "       I've been to both Sprouts stores and I like how each store does have a little something different to offer. This one has my favorite milk brand, Straus, that I've come to only find at Whole Foods. (Sidenote: it is a must for ppl to try especially if you're not lactose intolerant or even drink milk on a regular basis...you'll taste a big difference). The prices for produce are cheaper than Whole Foods, but you can make your own judgment call on the quality of it. I do love the double ad Wednesdays which both store locations are known to have. Come Wednesdays as there is a guy who likes to sample goodies and is the friendliest person you'll find in Vegas...somebody I note as the Sprouts ambassador. Oh, and you might see me working too that day.\n",

      "       I had a much better experience when this place was Sunflower Market. Now that it's Sprouts, I feel completely unwelcome here. Not one person greets you. Not one. Not one person asks you if you need any help. Not one. And to top it off, today I got the worst attitude from two of their cashiers ( the short white middle-aged woman who appeared a bit rough around the edges and the young skinny black girl with short hair). First off, I wasn't even greeted when I came up to the register. I said 'hello, how are you?' to the cashier (the white lady) and she didn't even answer back, but seemed really annoyed. She didn't even look at me or make eye contact with me. Just started ringing and bagging me up, with this stoic 'I hate my job' look on her face. As I was putting my bagged items into my cart, I turned around and she was gone. In her place was the black girl. She didn't say hi either. After ringing me up and giving me my total, I swiped my card and put in my pin. The pin was wrong. I had just gotten this card and I thought I had memorized my pin number, but I guess not. My phone (that had my pin on it) was in my car, so I asked if I could run out and get it. The black girl rolled her eyes at me and exhibited complete and utter displeasure towards my question, as if I completely ruined her day. And she didn't even answer the question, she just sat there, rolling her eyes, hesitating as if, in that very moment, a magical money-fairy would come down and zap cash into my pockets with her magic wand. I asked her again, if it would be ok to grab my phone, and she eventually said that it was fine, but with this hideous attitude. So I ran out and grabbed my phone, which literally took less than a minute (the Spouts parking is an empty void most of the time, so snagging a parking spot right out front isn't that hard). Anyhow, I get back and the white lady is standing there again. I'm thinking, 'oh great, not her again' and of course, her reaction towards the situation is to be completely patronizing. Finally I leave. I mean seriously? I'm a regular customer here. My husband and I shop here every other Thursday. A little respect would be nice. It was already shameful enough that I had forgotten my pin number and had to run out to my car and grab my phone, holding up the line. Then to feel degraded by these incompetent nimrods on top of it. . . . well that was just completely unacceptable. Needless to say, I'm disgusted. My husband and I will be joining our local buying clubs (a far better option) anyway, so thankfully I won't have to put up with them much longer. P.S. in case anyone is wondering why I didn't just charge my card. Well, because I don't like doing that. I'm looking out for businesses that I happen to support such as whole food markets like Sprouts. I would rather my retailer not have to pay a fee to the bank every time I charge my debit card. But, I guess it doesn't matter when a business such as this, has idiot cashiers who conduct business in a gross manner. Screw them.\n",

      "       I started shopping at Sprouts when I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Whole Foods. The Pros: They have killer specials on a lot of processed foods that are always pretty expensive at Whole Foods (Lara Bars, Late July, Emergen-C). Overall the store is reasonably priced. Shopping at Sprouts cut my usual grocery bill in half. I just don't think it is worth it. The Cons: They promote local(ish) meats, meat raised in the US, as if this is something to set them apart from other groceries. But they are vague about the origin of the meat. The last time I purchased meat at Sprouts, I returned it only 2 days later (2 days before the sell by date) because both cuts were spoiled already. Badly spoiled. This is a deal breaker for me. If I buy spoiled meat from your \"butchered fresh daily\" butcher, I can't go back. Their produce is supposed to be local, but much of it is the same that you will find in any grocery. Their non-organic produce is very reasonably priced, and they have some good deals on the organic stuff too, but it is nothing special and certainly not worthy of the \"farmer's market\" spin that they put on it. They don't always have what you bought last week. Their stock seems to shift, based on what they can get at a discount (to sell to you at a discount), but this is really inconvenient when you come to rely on certain grocery items weekly. (Edamame and other frozen veggies change regularly. The other day I went and they were completely out of pretzels, completely). Bottom line, I don't like that Sprouts markets itself as a local farmer's market type store. I have not found this to be true and it isn't up to snuff as far as quality grocers go.\n",

Not only is there gluten free selection higher then most, but they clearly label the items that are gluten free so you don't have to spend a tone of time reading labels. (because trust me that sucks) Being new to this whole gluten free thing Sprouts made it really easy on me. It's a bit of a drive but it was well worth my travels. The employees were nice, the store was clean, and I found way more stuff then I ever anticipated. Plus the prices were more then fair.

      "       We had Sprouts in California since I was in high school. It was a pretty big thing around the San Diego, Orange County, and Riverside areas. Just like the Sprouts they got over in California, the workers are really bitter and pissed off all the time. You constantly see workers fighting with each other and then while they are still angry they will take it out on the customers. Just like in California, the butcher and deli jerk will pretend that they do not see you in a lame attempt to avoid work or any verbal interaction. Unlike California, the bread selection sucks. The sourdough in the California locations was from a local bakery in SD. The sourdough here in the LV location tastes like wonder bread. Unlike California, there is no Spanish speaker to assist non-English speaking Latino customers. Last time I was here, I saw Latino customers who couldn't get any help because they didn't have even one Spanish speaker working that day. Even Korean restaurants have Spanish speakers on staff. So, what is going on here? In California, Sprouts were always located in upper-middle class areas such as Rancho Cucamonga, Temecula, Carlsbad, and San Diego. This Sprouts shares the same shopping center as a Goodwill, winos, bums, and an alley full of stray cats. Whenever I get out of my car there is always a f*cking cat there. +1 star for having the freshest produce in Las Vegas, and not being a douchebag hangout like Whole Foods.\n",

She is slow, forgetful, and never calls you back. I made the mistake of paying extra for a warranty on my sons glasses but am not able to take full advantage of it because Jessica isn't doing her job on her end.\n",

We are going on our third pair of trail contacts and it's been a year since we started. They never call me back, nor do they call when the contacts are in. I am so disappointed and will never order anything from this place business again. How many times can you tell the same customer your daughters contacts were lost and I have to reorder???\n",

I appreciate that he spends time explaining procedures and options and he's always making sure patients are comfortable. For me, my teeth are so very important and his work is exceptional. They take lots of insurance companies and they offer an in house type of insurance for those who don't have insurance which helps a lot.They also have Care Credit if needed. He knows dentistry and I trust him completely. He specialized in all dentistry from preventative to restorative and cosmetic. You don't need to go anywhere else!! Dr, Poulos is one of the best and it shows! A+++++ for him and his team!\n",

I recently had a small piece of tooth break off with some of the filling. I told them my discomfort was mild enough to wait for the next available appointment. I was surprised and grateful that they could see me the same day I called them. The office was busy when I arrived, but I was very happy with the care, attention, and treatment they performed. I mentioned to Dr. Poulos that I use to sell intraoral cameras to dentist here in Arizona. We had seminars at various resorts all over Arizona. We would demonstrate the intraoral camera and discuss the role of the intraoral camera and modern dentistry. The reason I'm mentioning this is that I have spent a considerable amount of time in the past interacting with dentist and their staff all over Arizona. I know an excellent dental practice when I see one. The next time I need dentistry I'm going back to see Dr. Poulos and the great people at that office.

He put on two veneers for me and they have each come off several times. He broke one of them which resulted in weeks of needing a temporary. I ended up needing an emergency root canal and took multiple trips to the emergency room due to extreme tooth pain as a result. I strongly recommend selecting another dentist.\n",

They took pictures ( I did not want nor request), then came with a piece of paper stating how much the service would be. My husband was told that he needed to have his fillings pulled and replaced. At check out, our bill for two cleanings, with bite wings was almost $1000.00 He went to get a second opinion, and because this office refused to forward his record 3 times, my husband had bite wings taken again. He didn't need the extra radiation. The second dentist told him that there ws NOTHING wrong with his fillings. It has been7 months and my records have not been forwarded yet after 3 requests. Needless to say, I recommend that you think twice about this rip off office. Get in writing EVERY penny that they plan on charging you.\n",

      "       Dr. Steven Rhodes came highly recommended by my Las Vegas Periodontist (who also moved here from Chicago and is nationally reknown). Dr. Rhodes and his staff went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and at ease. Appointments were generally kept in a timely fashion which was truly appreciated! Dr. Rhodes insures a wonderful and painless experience for most procedures. I find, unlike many other dental offices, Dr. Rhodes and his staff are compassionate, caring and most importantly, highly proficient and skilled. Dr. Rhodes has been voted one of the finest in the Las Vegas area, and his precise and creative genius is the obvious reason why!!! He is meticulous and exact--just what a patient expects when coming to an office of this caliber. In addition, the front desk exhibits exceptionally friendly customer service . I have spent many years in dentists' chairs and have had my share of dental issues and concerns. My smile is great! Dr. Rhodes spends a great deal of time with his patients, their treatment plans, and planned outcomes/time frames. When looking for a restorative dentist who does beautiful work, I I highly recommend Dr. Rhodes. I was there yesterday for an emergency. You can count on his office to take VERY good care of his patients and insure they are receiving the best treatment. He is the only practitioner I am highly recommending After all, we only want a beautiful smile, right???\n",

      "       I just came from Jill and she was definitely worth the visit! She made us feel really comfortable as soon as my husband and I walked in all the way until we left. What I liked about her is that she didn't just do the ultrasound and say what we were having in a boring way. (we got the gender reveal sneak peak) She made the experience memorable ! She was really engaged in us and let us see the baby from all angles. She didn't rush the moment or anything. She definitely knows what she's doing and if you're considering her I would say GO FOR IT! She's very reasonably priced (in my opinion) and good at what she does. She gives you a bunch of pictures, a CD that has all the pictures on them as well, a few flyers and a book with a lot of mommy/daddy information on them. Def go to her!\n",

      "       I loved loved stork vision! I had went at 16 weeks pregnant to another location in Phoenix due to prices, and I was so disappointed, she didn't talk to us and just clicked away. So I was skeptical about coming here, first off Jill is so knowledgable and seems just as excited as you and your family members are. It's a super cute boutique, and when I got there I paid her (Tuesdays she has a special 135 instead of 175, so worth it) and filled out a quick paperwork and then she brought me and my boyfriend and our family into the room. The bed I layed on was super comfortable and there was a sofa and chairs to fit my family. She talked to the baby and called her by her name and explained everything my baby was doing and also explained how I wasn't drinking enough water and showed me the amniotic fluid. I thought I was drinking a lot of water but apparently not, so drink on average 3 bottles more then you think is enough it's actually really important for the baby! The pictures came out good and I loved the video we got of the whole session. Would definitely recommend to anyone! So worth the money!\n",

      "       We just experienced one of the happiest mornings of our lives at Stork Vision this morning. Jill met with us bright and early so that we could get a peek of our baby for the first time. Having never been pregnant before, it was helpful to have an ultrasound performed by someone as knowledgeable and experienced as Jill. She was very informative and was able to get some incredibly clear pictures of our baby as well as a definitive gender determination, even at 16 weeks! The office is very inviting and clean. If you are pregnant, you absolutely must get a 3D ultrasound! It was some of the best $85 we have ever spent! Thank you so much! We'll be back at 30 weeks!\n",

      "       When I called to make my 30 week ultrasound appointment over the phone with Jill, I only had 1 main question. I asked: 1. We do NOT want to know the gender; is that a problem? She assured me that it would not be an issue. I excitedly booked the appointment, immediately wrote down the time &amp; cost on my calendar, and was really looking forward to sharing our ONLY ultrasound experience of the pregnancy with our families. When we first got to the appointment with all our family members, I went to the counter to pay and reminded Jill we did not want her to reveal the gender. Suddenly she said I had to pay MORE than what she told me over the phone. I asked why and she immediately became defensive saying that *I* misunderstood, that *I* was not remembering correctly, and that she has to \"be fair and charge everyone the same price because of the threat of any deals being leaked on social media\". UMM, WHAT!??! I understand not being able to hand out deals, but I was NOT asking for a deal - I was simply asking why I wasn't being charged the price SHE told me over the phone when I made the appointment. Her excuse was that repeat customers during the same pregnancy get a discount - Well, that's fine but I NEVER gave the impression that I had already had an earlier ultrasound with her during this pregnancy. I told her multiple times this is the only ultrasound we would be having for the entire pregnancy! She even admitted to documenting the lower price on my information sheet (and showed me where she wrote it), but refused to give me that price (!!!). I was so upset that she kept blaming me for her mistake and that she continued to argue about it. Once I put my money back in my wallet and told my husband I was ready to leave, her tune changed and she finally said she would honor the price she told me over the phone. Feeling bad that family had traveled out of town for the event, I agreed and we went through with the ultrasound. I honestly wish that I hadn't. I was almost in tears with how she unprofessionally handled the situation and how she immediately accused me of being a liar that it completely ruined the special experience for me. I had been here 2 years earlier for my first pregnancy and had a good experience then, but based on how I was rudely treated yesterday, I will never again refer anyone to Jill at Stork Vision in Chandler. If you want to be treated with respect, support someone else's business.\n",

      "       Would highly recommend this place to anyone! My husband and I went for the gender reveal option which is priced perfectly! My entire family got to sit in the room and watch as we found out our baby's gender! So fun! We were the only ones in the office so it was private and we could be as loud or quiet as we wanted. The ultrasound tech Jill, who is also the owner, was fabulous. There are two screens you can watch the ultrasound on so everyone can see. She was narrating through the entire experience and adding fun facts and details to make it unique and special to us. This just felt so much more intimate than going to the doctor's office. You get many print out black and white pictures along with a CD of your 2D/3D ultrasound pictures. She did 4D as well but the DVD was not included in the gender reveal. There are many packages to choose from but the gender reveal was perfect for us!\n",

      "       I went to Stork Vision in Chandler because I wanted to go somewhere that I knew an experienced ARDMSÂ® registered sonographer would be performing my ultrasound. I worried about having someone not all that experienced fishing around, not really knowing how to get the best images and possibly putting my baby in harm. I went to the right place. Jill is the owner and she performed my ultrasound. She has many years of experience and is properly licensed. She also made the appointment a wonderful experience for my husband and I and she has a great personality and kind demeanor. We were anxious to know the sex of our baby and I am happy to say we're having the baby boy we had hoped for! The facility is in a great location with Chandler mall and Bye Bye Baby just down the street. I wish we could have stopped by there and started our baby registry, but it was football Sunday and my husband wanted to get back home right away. The facility offers a lot of great products for sale that are very cute. The ultrasound room was clean and comfortable. There is a large screen TV on the wall for us to view our baby. Jill was able to produce some great shots of our lil guy for us. Afterwards we received a CD and print outs. I wound recommend Stork Vision Chandler to any expectant parents who would like to view their baby in 3D or 4D. It was a great experience for us and I'm so glad we did it.\n",

      "       This review is for the WI. Stoughton Hospital Sleep Test Clinic/Center.Not the Stoughton Hospital in general. Most people that works here are friendly, competent and provide good services, except for this one center. I'm just perplexed by my recent experience. When a costumer call this center, you'll get a recorded message that will say, \" U have reach the Stoughton Hospital Sleep Disorder Center, we are proud to provide you with exceptional personalize service.\" What a joke.! This is very comical.! This falls in the oxymoronic category.! Lol..! What kind of exceptional personalize service is that.? Every time a costumer calls this center of yours can't get a live person to talk to just schedule an appointment. I understand that this center is not open during business hours, If an attendant does not fit in your budget, why not change the recorded message..that says..you reach the Stoughton H. Sleep center... Sorry we're not open during regular business hours, if you leave your name, no. best time to call you. That is what u call exceptional quality service.! But know what, I tried calling many times at night, no success, it took 3 weeks ( phone tags) to finally get connected to a live person. With my frustrations with your process, I then decided to call UW Health clinic, I got connected to a live person for the first time I call then got scheduled for an appointment the same day. This center of yours have a sleep disorder problems, needed a doctor to fix the problem.\n",

      "       I visited Stoughton Hospital's urgent care for an injury to my hand. I hate to sound harsh, but I do not feel that the urgent care physician, Dr. Diebold, was helpful at all. He looked at my swollen finger, then looked up at me and asked me if I should get an x-ray. I have absolutely no medical training. My response was that I didn't know, and my visit to urgent care was to discuss antibiotics and a tetanus shot since the injury was an animal bite. If the urgent care physician would have ordered an x-ray, he would have found a fractured thumb bone as well as a broken-off bone fragment. On a positive note, the nurse was fantastic, and the overall experience in/out of the hospital was a very smooth process.\n",

      "       My two-year-old son was treated at Stoughton Hospital when he was having flu-like symptoms and difficulty breathing. I was nervous, as any parent would be in this situation, and the folks there were TERRIFIC! They identified my son's illness and treated him immediately. He was feeling better shortly and was LOVING all the kind people giving him attention there. They gave him stickers and talked directly to him, making him extremely comfortable. He was scared to be there because he's young and has very little experience with doctors. The doctors that saw him took extreme care to make sure he was happy and being taken care of. I was so impressed with their professionalism as well as their ability to calm my son. Thanks to those involved for making my little guy feel better!\n",

      "       honestly, i didn't know what to expect when my son and i showed up for his first appointment at this office. we are new to arizona and i have had both good and bad experiences in the past in all medical-type environments, as my son is autistic, and i never know just how far i can push him on a daily basis. the first thing i noticed was how warmly we were greeted. the nice blonde-ish gal at the front desk met eyes with me and smiled the moment i opened the door. somebody give her a raise! there was a movie playing in the lobby, which was awesome because as soon as my son realized we were in a \"doctor office\", he wanted to leave immediately. having the movie on settled his nerves and he chilled out in his chair until i finished the paperwork and we got called back. still uncertain and a little wary of how my son would react, the dental assistant asked me first and foremost if we were doing okay.. if we needed anything.. i explained our situation and she responded with sincere compassion, kindness, and understanding. my son let her look in his mouth and even clean his teeth. let me emphasize how huge it is that he allowed a stranger in his mouth! oh but the best part? when they lean the kids' chairs back, the same movie from the lobby is playing on a tv on the CEILING. this is above and beyond.. not to mention genius. another thing i will say about this office.. they have the one dentist and i swear i couldn't have chosen someone who treated my son with so much dignity and respect. of course my tiny human was in tears but i could tell that this man really cares about his patients. he took his time with my son, was patient with him, explained to me (the worrying mommy) what i needed to know, gave me adequate time to ask questions.. did not rush me out the door. overall i felt that my son and i were well taken care of.. i have never felt so comfortable being at the dentist, especially with my son. 5 stars across the board.\n",

      "       This Dental Office truly made my day more enjoyable. I've had a tremendous fear of the dentist since the age of 10 and have been looking for a place in Vegas that would really help me maintain my oral hygiene without great fear. This was my first visit and definitely will not be my last! The staff was very welcoming and informative with everything they were doing. The technology and equipment used was very impressive. Kudos to Beverly Udell my now new dental hygienist who made my experience very enjoyable and a true professional that knows how to be gentle. Thank you Sunrise Dental! I look forward to seeing you in a few months for my teeth whitening and my 6 month cleaning! Look no further Sunrise Dental is the perfect place for all your oral hygiene needs.\n",

Being relatively new to the area, we feel very fortunate to have found SunRise Dental. It will become our family's dental office for many reasons. Nancy, at the reception area who deals with insurance issues, is patient, kind and thorough. The soothing ambience and cleanliness is another plus. Highly recommended! Dental appointments can be a pleasant experience! Very satisfied.\n",

      "       Yay I think I've finally found a permanent home for my teeth! Sunrise Dental Henderson is a beautiful office run by amazing staff. The ladies at the front desk make you feel very welcome and are extremely friendly. The dentist I've seen in the past had a large practice with three dentists. There were always tons of patients in the waiting room and you never knew which dentist you were going to get. Sunrise Dental Henderson is run by one dentist and you really get that small town, family feeling from them. They have a large TV in the waiting room and cold bottles of water available for their patients. Once you go inside, the dental chairs are separated by partitions and makes it feel very open and spacious. Dr. Seto is young and very friendly. Each chair has a TV screen and it's not one of those that you can only see when it's at a certain angle- they are NICE TVs! They have great promotions on their website with very reasonable prices for cleanings/XR/exams/etc. They have an online appointment booking system which makes it convenient to book exams- no more having to phone tag to book a dental appointment! I would highly, highly recommend Sunrise Dental!\n",

They perform their treatment protocols just exactly as how we are taught in the academe. This means that Dr. Seto does not push for any unnecessary treatments. I had a tiny incipient caries that other dentists could have easily pushed for a two-surface restoration but she did not because it is known that such type of caries may be remineralized with fluoride. Sommer performed an excellent periodontal maintenance on me as well.\n",

Even though that part was annoying, the tech helped make that part of the process bearable. She was very friendly and told me when it was almost over. LOL The individual rooms have flat screens so you can watch tv while you get your teeth cleaned or while you are waiting for the dentist. They use the TV to show you your X-rays! That was the best part! The dentist explained what I was looking at, took pictures and showed me how I can floss better. Overall a great experience!\n",

      "       Needed a new dentist in the henderson area and called SunRise Dental to make an appointment. Very friendly and professional staff. I have some work that's going to take a while, but my first appointment went very well. Got my teeth cleaned (it had been way too long!) and the staff was great. My first treatment went well too with no pain during the treatment and little soreness afterward. I tend to not go to the dentist as often as I should because I get anxiety about the pain. This was a positive experience and I would recommend to anyone needing a local dentist!\n",

      "       Had my first office visit with SunRise Dental this morning. Let me backtrack, I haven't seen a dentist in about a year, so I was due for a visit. I called around my nearby dentist offices and the first two places had an appointment available 3-4 was away! SunRise dental was my third pick only by distance and they were able to schedule me for the next day, which was for this morning! Yes, a dentist office that works on weekends! So I went in early to fill out the normal paperwork and such. The reception area was neat and comfortable. The receptionist was nice and attentive. She let me know in advance about my insurance possibilities on how the office would show me what I would pay, after insurance, for procedures done! Wow! No surprises after the work is done! :) I then met my hygienist with smiles and welcomes. She escorted to the back office area which was clean and well kept. Took my DIGITAL X-rays and was impressed by the sanitation efforts after the X-rays. She wiped down everything she touched with those wipe sanitizers! Yes, DIGITAL X-rays were easier and more comfortable to take than those old film type X-rays of years before! I was then moved to the examination chair and the hygienist went over what she was going to do and such. She went over my teeth, checking the gums and teeth. I knew I haven't been doing well flossing so what she told me wasn't a surprise but she was efficient in the initial procedure. From there she went into my general teeth cleaning, my deep cleaning was going to need insurance approval so that is going to be another day. So I thought she wasn't going to do much, but she got in there and gave me a good cleaning! She worked on me for a while and I was impressed by her meticulous attention to detail in getting all that she could in this general cleaning! She then polished my teeth and I was ready for the examination by the Dr. Dr Lee was briefed on my sheet/teeth and introduced himself with a good handshake. He went over my DIGITAL X-rays with me and made me feel comfortable before looking in my mouth as I knew I had at least two cavities that were probably ready to be filled.... His examination was gentle and informative, he noticed I had in fact three cavities and a chipped tooth! I thought I had a chipped tooth but anyways..... He said my cavities weren't big gaping holes yet, but they are a good size that now need to be filled. That, I knew, just didn't want to hear it. :(. Then the Dr thanked me for coming in shook my hand again. I was then taken back to the receptionist area, but on the \"inside\" side where there was a comfortable chair to sit in while the receptionist, which by the way, her business card reads, \"insurance/treatment plan coordinator\". After sitting down with her I agree to that title! She went over my treatment plan and made suggestions to save me money and appointments! She was detailed in that she gave me a sheet with all that I needed to have done. With prices! Now my issuance hasn't been verified, so the prices on the sheet were non insurance prices, but will find out tues feb 11th what will be my out of pocket expenses. She explained what the picture of the teeth on my sheet and codes. She thanked me for being a new patient and gave me a welcome gift! I was given a nice reusable shopping bag with something in it! I didn't look inside till I got home and to my surprise it had a blanket in it! I know! Wow! I thought it was going to be something cheesy, but it was a nice throw blanket that I can use to snuggle in front of the TV. :). I also was given the traditional Baggie of goodies, toothbrush, toothpaste and dental floss. :) So here it is, my first visit and review of SunRise Dental. I was impressed by their friendly customer service, sanitation requirements/attentiveness and at the end the bringing it down to earth by the sit down chat afterwards! That right there felt that they were interested in me as a person rather than a number where normally at my other dentist all they wanted was a payment and a next appointment date! So kudos to this whole office for making the visit to the dentist office a pleasant one. JM\n",

      "       I went to the office on Rainbow being that I live in this side of town. Pointless because the office isn't set up for X-Rays. I had to go wait two weeks for the other office across town for X-Rays. On the Third visit he handed me my insoles and said have a good day. Each visit was $30 co-pay and only one visit was longer than 2 min. I understand paying for doctor visits but $30 just to pick up my insoles. When if they could have provided the service at the original location I would have only needed two visits. Just disappointed in the office\n",

      "       Terrible. Not sure how this place has 5 stars (they're probably all fake). I went to this clinic as recommended by my insurance and they make you sign a bunch of paperwork before you can even chat with the doctor (yes, it's true you don't have to sign anything, but if you don't, you get no service). I kept saying to the nurse and doctor multiple times that I don't think the procedure they wanted to do was the correct one (ingrown nail removal) because I didn't have one. The doctor was very brief, cutting me off and wanting me to sign the consent saying that this would solve the problem. He removed part of my toe nail, charged me over $500 dollars for this and aside from the initial discomfort I had, I now have a lot of pain on my toe PLUS the same discomfort. It look me over a month of bleeding toe and pain to heal and I called the office several times since they said the bleeding would stop in up to 48 hours. In other words, it did not solve the problem, it made it worse and I tried to call them to see if the doctor would see me again to resolve this issue so it's fair for me to pay this amount or if they can adjust the amount I owe and the lady said \"you signed a consent form, there's nothing I can do. You could have said no\". This is the worst place for you to take care of your feet! I now have to find another doctor to correct what they have done and pay out of pocket as well as paying for this clinic with a bunch of unprofessional people.\n",

      "       I rarely leave 1-star reviews, but having had read some positive reviews on Yelp and then eventually going in due to those, I'm left with disappointment, yet getting charged more money for no good reason, and not actually getting any positive outcome. I believe many people like him because he does in fact have a very warm personality. My challenge is that I didn't get much indication that he was a good podiatrist, and I got a lot of clues that he wasn't. I would definitely not recommend friends not to go to this doctor -- and I'm leaving my review where many negatives and pretty much zero positives, adds up to a 1-star review. Not a horror story, but certainly a lot of mistakes and pretty much zero help. 1. First, it was definitely weird to be in a private room with a computer screen open with patient names and info and seemingly no timeout where it went to screen saver. (I was in the room 20-30 minutes and the screen was up the entire time.) When I casually mentioned this to the doctor a few minutes after he came in, he likened this to how anyone can see anyone else's name on the sign-in sheet up front. I think the difference I see though is that I was in a private room with a computer system that I possibly could have clicked around on and discovered private health info. I can't confirm this but whether or not his practice was breaking HIPPA privacy laws but I did see that the system I could click around on (which I didn't because that's weird!) seemed to have more info than just scheduling...and it gave a taste of sketchiness right off the bat. Even if its just a podiatrist, I prefer that random people in his office not see my private health information while they're waiting on the doc. 2. Before I spoke with the doctor, they automatically took an X-ray. I believe that in my particular circumstance, this was unnecessary and just a way for them to collect a few extra bucks from the health insurance company and from me. He made no reference to the X-rays and my condition didn't warrant X-rays. I have been to several other podiatrists and they would during the appointment say \"there's no reason to take an X-ray\" (I have flat feet that's been forever, and certain activity would bring about numbness in a certain part of my toe, so I was seeking advice about whether different footwear was warranted). 3. He made a claim that the shoes I was wearing were bad for my particular feet, yet they had been recommended by another doctor and actually have made my day to day foot comfort more positive. I can't be sure since I'm not a podiatrist but this would also give me another negative indication towards his competence. 4. He was pretty insistent that I buy orthopedic foot inserts from his clinic and that they would likely improve my condition. When I went to check out, the bill included these, and the front office clerk gave me the inserts and threw away the box. I thought this was a little odd, but after the fact realized \"Eh I don't really want these.\" I decided to try them, they actually worsened the condition -- all they did was further compress my foot in the shoe, making the numbness I would get come on slightly faster. I searched for these inserts online and saw that they were about 2x the price at the podiatrist than they were in stores and that they were very much a \"one size fits all\" situation, so not even as good as those Dr Scholls \"semi custom fit orthotics\" with the machine at Walgreens, CVS, etc (where they have a few different sizes). Of course, I couldn't return these since I didn't have the box they came in. And of course, they also didn't go through insurance, they were just charged to me out of pocket. 5. Their billing department also seems extremely disorganized. They sent me a bill with \"additional charges\" about 3-4 months after my visit. They were unable to tell me what and why the charges existed when I called (several times), and since it was under $50 I decided to just pay it because time is money. A few months later, I got more \"additional charges.\" Their \"billing specialists\" are unable to explain anything and just say \"maybe you should call your insurance company.\" My insurance company had a fixed co-pay for this doctor yet most of their additional charges are coming for \"Office Visit\" so this is clearly a provider issue. I highly recommend not dealing with this doctor or this office unless you want to buy some unnecessary goodies and have a future headache dealing with their billing team.\n",

      "       I was actually seeing a different podiatrist however due to some drama with THAT doc, my co-worker referred me to his friend Dr. Wood. Having my foot surgery postponed twice &amp; up against a deadline with my health insurer I literally had 2 weeks to find a new doc &amp; have this surgery. I met with Dr Wood once and my surgery was done within the week. Now...everyone's situation will be different and surgery may not be necessary BUT I tore the peroneous brevis tendon 2 years ago &amp; it just wasn't healing. A quick review of my last MRI &amp; symptomology and it was a no brainer. I also had an ingrown nail on the same foot and he took care of that during the surgery too. During the surgery there were a few surprises he found but took care of it. I am 2 months post op &amp; my incision looks great. I am happy with it. The pain I experienced the last 2 years is no longer present; I'm just dealing with post surgical swelling, tightness &amp; discomfort. I'd call it a success. He's a nice guy. Straight and to the point. Up beat. Laid back. Easy going. Fills out your FMLA papers with you in the office so you don't have to wait for them like you do with some doctors. I have never waited more than 10 minutes to be seen. I have always received a reminder call the day before an appointment. The girls are really nice &amp; helpful. I'd recommend seeing him if your foot is bugging ya. He's pretty no nonsense. When I showed him what my prior podiatrist was going to do surgically, not only was I not aware of a few procedures she had planned but he &amp; I discussed it and didn't see any reason to do it unless I wanted it done. If I have any further issues with my feet...I'll see him again.\n",

      "       Dr. Wood is awesome! I made the mistake of going to Advanced Orthopedics for over 2 months with nearly 20 physical therapy sessions, no clear diagnosis (and lots of run around, referring out for tests to people who didn't even take my insurance, passing me off between doctors, no one returning my calls and some of my charts said I was a MAN), before I got fed up and went to Sunrise Foot and Ankle. Sunrise is a small office which means you will get personalized attention. Dr. Wood had my issue diagnosed on the first visit, surgery scheduled and I've had the surgery and am already about 95% recovered, just a few more days to take the stitches out and thats it! He had the entire issue diagnosed, surgery scheduled, surgery performed and follow-up appointments, taken care of ALL within 3 weeks of my FIRST visit! The surgery was short &amp; sweet with no issues whatsoever! At Advanced Orthopedics, I paid literally HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS of dollars because they didn't refer out to doctors on my insurance, because they obviously didn't care to double check. But at Sunrise Foot and Ankle, WITH surgery and all my appointments I have seriously not even paid $100 yet! (Whhhat???!! It's true!!!) and the receptionist had the rough estimate for me even before the surgery. I couldn't be happier! Even Dr. Wood knew information about my insurance company that he informed ME about. Wherever you live in the valley, this office is worth the drive.\n",

She is really good at sending you emails about any test or scans you get as soon as she gets them. She also sends you the results that she get from other doctors. I can't say enough about her, she is wonderful. I have also seen Dr. Horrocks and he is really good about listening to your needs and talking to you about anything you need. Neither one of them talk down to you or treat you like a number. The wait time is really great, normally you get in within 5-10 minutes. Go see them!\n",

The office is in a nice professional building and is always clean. Even though I now live in Glendale, I will make the 20 minute drive to see Dr. Horrocks.

Of course since I pay a hefty premium for \"good\" insurance outside the marketplace and not some government subsidy mooching off hard working individuals they don't want to take it. Guess this is what's to come from Obama Care and the wonderful doctors and practitioners who will be in charge of our well being. Sad day for the USA. Maybe a phone call before I drove over there, had to make childcare arrangements and take off work would have been the courteous thing to do.

Bobby our artist not only resized it to what we wanted, he took the crappy picture we brought and turned it into an awesome dragon! The shading is spectacular, so much more than what we expected. We both left super happy! If we ever get more we are definitely coming back to Tattoo Bills. The staff was very friendly and the prices very reasonable. I would recommend them to everyone! We went again another occasion for piercing. Chris Thigpen was awesome! He walked us through step by step from the process (which they are very clean!); to aftercare of our piercings. He was fast!

Getting a tattoo removed is no simple decision and everyone knows it hurts, but he was such a nice guy that I was totally at ease. Speaking of hurt - holy shittake mushrooms - that's some of the most uncomfortable and sharpest pain I have ever felt. The tattoo I'm getting removed is on my rib cage so maybe that has something to do with it.. but damn. OUCH. It hurts. Way worse than when I got the tattoo 6 years ago.

      "       I had my triple forward helix pierced by Chris at Tattoo Bill's on 10/25/2016. When I arrived, the piercing artist was outside on the bench in front of the store. He did not acknowledge me. After waiting ten to fifteen minutes he returned to the counter. I asked a few questions and he was short and rude. I had called earlier and been given the price of $60 jewelry included. However when I asked, he said it was $70. I explained that I had called earlier and the guy who answered the phone had told me otherwise. He simply brushed it off as a \"miscommunication\". I got pierced anyway against my better judgement. The piercing process seemed to take too long and was painful. He could not get the jewelry in correctly and the whole process was sloppy. After leaving, I was concerned with the placement of the piercing as well as the jewelry used. In order to get a second professional opinion, I visited Sadu Body Piercing and Modifications. Cindy, one of the professional piercers expressed concern over the placement of the piercing. She explained that the holes were uneven, and the first hole was prone to rejection due to the piercing being made too shallow, and not pierced correctly through the cartilage. You are able to feel the bar of the jewelry through the outermost part of the ear, unlike the other two piercings. She also explained that the jewelry used is externally threaded and in other words is cheap. She was extremely nice and seemed knowledgable/credible. Her advice was to take the jewelry out in order to avoid problems. I wanted to follow her advice and take out the piercings, allow it to heal, and have it repierced at a different piercing location. I returned to Tattoo Bill's to respectfully voice my dissatisfaction. I spoke with the piercing artist and he immediately became defensive. He agreed that the placement could be better. I asked for a refund of my $70 and he refused while becoming increasingly more irritated, and yelling to his other coworkers sitting nearby that a refund would not be granted. He offered to repierce the piercing, but this did not satisfy me. Why would someone want a poor piercing redone at the same place and risk having to go through the same painful process with a chance of having the same poor results? That does not make sense. The owner was sitting near the front of the shop and could overhear what was going on and realized I was not pleased with the response I had gotten. He asked me what the issue was. I politely explained and was again given the same answer. Meanwhile, the piercer yelled that he, \"does not like those dykes at Sadu Body Piercing\" and basically that their opinion is not valid. I was given $30 by one of the other guys there who clearly just wanted to resolve the issue, however I am still unsatisfied. I wanted the piercing removed along with the rest of my $40. Their behavior was inappropriate, offensive and they displayed very poor customer service. I have had another bad piercing experiences here when I got my Tragus pierced. They pushed the needle too far and stabbed the inner part of my ear near the conch. I am appalled by their behavior and lack of concern for recurring clients. I will never return to this place and I will make sure that everyone I know is aware of how awful my experiences have been.\n",

      "       I started my search for tattoo removal several months (around 6) before I found Bill's Tattoo Removal. In my search I went to at least 3 or 4 consultations, and spoke to at least 6 or 7 clinic's about pricing, payment methods, insurance, etc. etc. It was very overwhelming, and the biggest thing was, A. My schedule- I needed a place that could do this for me during the weekend as I work 9-5, mon-fri. B. price- some of these procedures can be very very expensive. I mean... I've been quoted 600-700 dollars/ procedure with an estimated number of 8 or 9 procedures. Those rates were just not going to be doable to me. I should add that I consider my tattoo to be smaller... I have 4 or 5 birds on each side of my chest, so yeah... It's at least a medium sized tattoo, but it's not anything huge. Needless to say, I was feeling very discouraged, and I ended up booking an appointment with a place in Atlanta because (even adding gas mileage) it was still so much cheaper than everything around here. That was when I lucked up and found Tattoo Bill's online. I called and made an appointment with an estimated price of like... 150 dollars. He sounded very casual with his appointment making, which at first kinda off put me because I was concerned I would drive from Greensboro to Charlotte then him not be able to see me. Fast forward a few weeks to the date of my appointment. I make the drive to Tattoo Bills, and pull into the small shop in the middle of a shopping center. From the outside you see the tattoo shop, and the removal shop (brilliant business scheme, right?) I go inside, and I'm not going to lie... There are a bunch of burly looking men in this place, but they are all so sweet! Everyone is friendly, and Frank (the guy who does the removals) is the best. He will answer all of your questions, regardless of how many you have (and I had ton) He's very realistic in how many sessions you're going to need, and everything is very neat and clean. The sanitation was my biggest concern. He has a great groupon too. It was like.. A little over 200 dollars for 3 sessions, which basically equals a free session for me.

      "       I have visited here 4 times so far, once for consultation and 3 tattoo removal sessions. I went to here after having had several sessions at another place and oh how I wish I had found him first. Frank does the removals &amp; is very personable. He is knowledgeable about the process and is very receptive to questions/concerns. The previous place I was going to, the guy was suggesting I have a laser session every 3 to 4 wks, obviously just to maximize profit. Frank encouraged me to wait atleast 3 months between sessions to minimize scarring and to allow the site to heal from the laser. I have decided to hold off on anymore sessions for a while just to see how it continues to progress on its on. In the 3 sessions that I have had, I have seen more difference than I expected. If I decide to proceed with additional session I will certainly drive the 35 to this place.\n",

I can't say enough about the atmosphere and the down home southern hospitality at this shop. I love it there, I would go there just to hang out and talk with the guys if it didn't seem creepy on my part that is. The owner is one of the nicest men you will ever meet and that sincere sentiment is passed along through his employees as well. No doubt the most comfortable and laid back tattoo shop I have ever been in. I even took my wife there to get a tattoo and she is tattoo sensitive (she thinks they hurt a lot). She got her ink like a champ, no pain and no problems. I even had my daughter's nose pierced there, they handled her like she was their own child. I was really impressed. If you are looking to get inked this is the place to go. Tattoo Bill's does a great job and they make you feel like family, what else could be better!\n",

      "       Wowwwww - what an awesome dental office for kids!!! I booked my daughter's first dentist appointment here because of the amazing reviews and when we opened the door, my daughter smiled and laughed because she thought it was a playground! The decor with the wood floors and little play area with grass, books and toys is every baby/toddler's wonderland. All my daughter wanted to do was play and crawl but we were called back to one of the dental chair rooms to answer a few questions. All the employees were so sweet and the assistant noticed that all my daughter wanted to do was play so she brought in a few toys and books for her to play with in the dental chair room. Of course, the little one cried when the dentist came to check her teeth, but even the dentist was super patient and sweet. My daughter started crying because she wanted him to pick her up and he picked her up and held her. I didn't feel rushed and he wanted to make sure all my questions were answered. It was a great first dentist experience. When we checked out, they give your child a small toy to go home with. What kid would be scared of going to the dentist after this?! Man, I remember I hated going to the dentist when I was little. I would run away from home just because I was so scared. I'm pretty sure my daughter wouldn't ever be scared and run away like I did because this dental office is freakin awesome!!!\n",

In fact the theme of the office has a special feel to it. I am sure it has something to do with the friendly and engaging staff. Each person stopped what they were doing to acknowledge my little one as she came and went. Even though she is too young to notice, I certainly appreciated the personal attention. The appointment was fast and the dentist was gentle. I look forward to taking my baby here for a very long time.\n",

Up until we went to Dr Guymon a few weeks ago, my 3 year old daughter wouldn't stop crying long enough to have a thorough dental exam. So when her previous dentist thought she spotted a cavity, I was terrified. So, I searched online to find another dentist that she wouldn't be scared of. That's when I found Dr Guymon. My daughter instantly felt comfortable in his office. The office is calm and relaxing and the decor is inviting. My daughter let him look in her mouth and even let his assistant take x-rays (we tried at the previous dentist with no luck). Everything in Dr Guymon's office is clean and with-the-times. From offering online medical forms, to the super fast and easy handheld x-ray device, to flat screen tvs on the ceilings, to a contemporary waiting and play area, this office has it all. And his staff is amazing. My daughter had 2 cavities filled by Dr Guymon today, and she is excited to go back again. I don't know how he does it!\n",

My 10 year old son is on the autism spectrum and has pretty severe sensory processing disorder. Laura, the hygienist, is amazing with him! She goes over every single thing she's going to do with him before she does it and is incredibly gentle, kind and encouraging to him! Dr. Guymon is calm, funny and easy to work with. He presents his findings and discusses all of our options in a manner that never makes us feel rushed. I never leave there feeling unsure about what the next step will be. We went to another pediatric dentist's office in Phoenix for 4 years where they would never even attempt to do a cleaning. This year, my son has had two cleanings and actually looks forward to going to the dentist! That says A LOT!! I highly recommend Tatum Pediatric Denistry!!\n",

My kids have had fillings and all, BUT they get excited going into the office. They think it's \"cool\" in there. Not to mention I love the decor in the office, ADORABLE!! Thank you Dr Guymon and Tatum Pediatric Dentistry for being friendly and welcoming and for genuinely caring. If only all healthcare treated their patients like this! Ya'll are pretty sweet!\n",

      "       Today was our second visit to Tatum pediatric. My daughter has had some traumatic experiences in the past with other dentist offices. Needless to say she has anxiety when the word dentist is mentioned. Today started out rough and she was very scared and didn't want to take the pictures. Our dental hygenist* so sorry I am awful with names* was simply amazing. She was able to calm my 8 year old down, get all her photos taken, exam complete and cleaning done all with smiles and giggles. I am so happy for my daughter and the future of her dental experience. We all know how \"fun\" it can be, but at Tatum pediatric I like to think it can be. From the fun waiting room to the tvs above the dental chair and finishing with a gold coin to claim your special prize. I will be recommending all of my friends and family! Thank you :)\n",

      "       We love Dr Guymon. We used to see Dr Guymon at another dental practice and we are so glad that he has his own practice now. He is a very gentle and caring dentist. I have always felt that he doesn't push unnecessary treatment and expense. The office is so beautiful and any child would feel welcome being there. My daughter Zoe really enjoys the TV screens above the exam chairs ...it helps distract her from having people stick their hands in her mouth. There are great places for the kids to hang out before their appointments and they also have a large family style exam/cleaning room so siblings can all get their teeth cleaned simultaneously...we actually drive a good distance to come and see Dr Guymon and it is worth it. I highly recommend Dr Guymon.\n",

      "       We feel so lucky to have found Dr. Guymon and Tatum Pediatric Dentistry. I don't even know where to begin because every detail of every part of our dental experience with TPD was beyond exceptional - even to me, a very very picky mom. To begin, the front office was extremely accommodating and pleasant during the scheduling process. She verified our insurance benefits and called me back to explain what I could expect financially, and explained what we could expect during our visit. When we arrived at the office I was extremely impressed at the care and commitment Dr Guymon and staff have made to assure the comfort of patients and parents. The office is immaculately clean - I had no concern at all for my daughter to play with the toys and books on display. Additionally, the forest theme of the office is beautifully designed - everything is child sized, bright, friendly, and welcoming. My daughter was excited to be there! Dr Guymon's medical assistant was kind, patient, and engaging to my 2 year old while going over health/dental history questions with me and during my daughters exam with the Doctor. Dr Guymon himself is extremely kind, patient, detailed, and gentle. Dr Guymon took plenty of time talking to us to find out about our at-home dental routine, gave us recommendations on how to get a better clean at home, engaged my daughter and made her feel extremely comfortable during her cleaning, took time to answer all of my question, was very thorough, nice, and has proven himself over and over that he really cares about his patients! Him, his staff, and office are extremely clean! Last year we had a minor dental emergency and Dr Guymon quickly called me back on the weekend and even checked in with us several times over the following days. This was above and beyond what I have experienced from other Dentists. I'm a very particular when it comes to the care of my child and I highly recommend Dr Guymon for an exceptional experience and care for your child.\n",

She is always very scared at the pediatrician's office, but Dr. Guymon and Kendra completely put her at ease. Both my husband and I were shocked at how well she did. They were both so comforting, nice, and really explained things well to us. The office is fantastic for children. It is beautifully designed and so much fun. There are even TV's over the exam chairs so the kids can focus on watching a movie while getting checked out. The whole place was also amazingly clean. I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Guymon, his team, and Tatum Pediatric Dentistry. We are so glad to have found such an amazing place for our children.\n",

There are very few things in life better than not having to fight your 3 year old to get him to go to the dentist! And from the parents' perspective this place is great. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the decoration of the lobby is honestly impressive even for us parents, and I can't say enough about Dr Guymon. He's not only very good at what he does, but he's excellent at communicating everything to both me and my son, and you can tell he genuinely enjoys what he does and cares about the kids. I've referred 3-4 friends there and every one of them has had nothing but great things to say, a couple of them have even recently moved to other parts of town yet still come to Tatum Pediatric, they're just that good!\n",

Needless to say a few years later and his own business now (which he deserves very much) I'm still going to him! He is the BEST and I don't believe there is anyone else out there like him! He loves what he does and has a passion for helping people that are in pain or have been in a car accident!! Even though I have a pinched nerve in my neck that I will have to live with for the rest of my life just going to see Teddy once a month helps me tremendously! He's professional and very caring and I highly recommend him to anyone that has an injury or pain in your neck or back! I promise he will help you!!

Just one adjustment from Dr. Ted gave me the first peaceful night of sleep I had had in months.

      "       Love, love, love The Art of Massage (TAOM) on Selwyn Ave! Don't be concerned by the grandma's basement type feel and creaky stairs when you first enter the building (it's right next to Selwyn Pub). The actual massage space upstairs is very nicely decorated, clean and serene. I've been at different times of day, and thankfully you don't hear the other businesses in the building with the fan and soothing music. Melissa is beyond amazing, but I've heard the other therapists are great too and they offer many different types of massage, including ashiatsu, which I think is really cool. They definitely cater to the customer and your needs. Melissa has an awesome technique with deep tissue massage (her neck work is top notch!), plus she is knowledgeable, thorough and kind, and not chatty like you sometimes get at other places. I have chronic pain and I'm there to get some relief! I've been to loads of massage places over the years - including high-end spas and membership clubs and Melissa ranks up there with my top three fave massage therapists ever. It's so satisfying to find the right mix of personality (someone who is friendly and listens), along with having excellent technique / skills. I'm extremely grateful I finally listened to others who kept telling me how great TAOM was and that I found such a gifted massage therapist as Melissa!\n",

      "       If you are looking for a quality massage, you have found the place and Raquel is the best therapist in Charlotte. After trying several therapist in the city, I found Raquel who is very attentive to reading your body and determining what is needed to provide a great deep tissue massage that leaves you feeling incredible. She does not simply rub lotion on your body, she works the problem areas and releases the stress and tension from the muscles so you leave feeling amazing. The Art of Massage is conveniently located, has a great atmosphere and a respectful staff. One tip: when you arrive do not get concerned if it looks as though there is no parking in front of the building...go beside the building and to the back where there is a large parking lot and plenty of space.\n",

      "       I received a gift card to The Art of Massage. I sat on it for a few months....and today, I decided it was time. I went to the website. ... they had an online scheduling option. Since I knew no therapist there...i decided to test my luck with whomever was available. I landed on the table of Raquel Hainsel. The massage place is in a shared building with a few independent salon owners and a couple of other small businesses. This bothers some people (based on old yelp reviews)....but not me.....im a hairstylist and I work in a similar situation. It's not a corporate factory...so if that experience is what you are looking for....then keep moving. I was greeted when i walked into the suite by Raquel. She was super nice. I told her exactly what I wanted, and told her what I didn't like in previous massages. Raquel DELIVERED......over and beyond. Girl has intuitive hands and great skill. I felt like I received great therapy without ever being in pain with too much preasure. Her routine was extremely well planned and balanced. She covered head to toe in 90 minutes and the service never felt rushed. When the service was finished, i was offered an opportunity to book my next appointmeny and an opportunity to save. While I was on the table, i was already thinking about my next visit and how quickly I could return. I bought a package where you purchase 4 massages and receive the 5th for free. Basically it works out to about $ 84 a massage. Since I'm someone who gets massages frequently, I am ok with paying for quality. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and Um.glad that i was introduced to this business. I hope you will take a moment to try it out yourself.\n",

I went in primarily for back/neck pain relief, but Kaleigh efficiently got to my arms, legs, feet and scalp as well without rushing me in or out. Very Nice. Thanks!\n",

      "       I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here. The massage was good, but the ambiance is lacking. Part of the problem is that the business shares a building with several other businesses. I found the building a little hard to find, since there is no sign out front. Also, once upstairs and in the room, I was surprised at how small it was. There is a distinct smell of mildew, as another reviewer mentioned. I know that for individual massage therapists with a small business, there aren't many options. So I sympathize with the need to rent space in a shared building. I would highly recommend however that the owner look for a more accommodating space. The website is very professional and contrasts highly with the lack of a professional workspace.\n",

      "       Wonderful! I bought a travelzoo offer as I've been having 2 weeks of muscle cramps. That was absolutely a great decision. The Art of Massage is in a basic office building - park in back - with several other small businesses. The waiting room is actually the end of a hallway. I wasn't too sure while I waited, but Melissa gave me an AWESOME massage and worked out all of those cramps and sore points. I feel better than I have in weeks. They do have package programs and take FSA/HSA debit cards. I wish they weren't so far from Matthews, but I'll make the drive.\n",

      "       Erin was in Charlotte today! (3/29/13) I was very lucky to be able to have a great 2 hour massage with her. Its never a good idea to go without a massage for as many months as I did but Erin is in great demand these days and with my wonky schedule getting together is nearly impossible. But yesterday the stars aligned and she was able to make some progress on my knot filled back. We did 2 hours of ashiatsu. It was painful but it was bliss. Art of Massage has been doing some redecorating. I'm not quite sure what it is that they're trying to say with the new look of their ashiatsu room. When I entered it my immediate thought was how dark it was. It had an abstract piece of art on the wall and another of someone turned away from the viewer. Both pieces radiated darkness and coldness. There were heavy dark drapes that blocked out all of the light. Welcoming elements such as the salt lamp were gone and thet were replaced by a dark colored dresser with light blue handles. The handles looked luminescent in the low light. There is only a single table in the room. The room reminds me of one of those Internet puzzles where you try to escape the room by clicking on various elements. A new addition was an iPad on the top of the dresser. Clients check out via the iPad with their therapist in the rooms rather than out in the lobby. The waiting area outside AoM hasn't been updated yet.\n",

      "       Okay, I gotta admit, I hate giving this place a 3 star rating because the massage itself was AWESOME. But here's the problem, the massage therapist talked the ENTIRE time. No joke. It wasn't relaxing. When I pay $75 for an hour massage, I want to leave feeling relaxed, renewed and free of worry. Instead, I left with information about her boyfriend, her life, her mom, etc. The other issue-- she wanted me to talk back! I would have to answer the 'you know?' question and say a 'yeah' and an 'mmhm' While I thought the massage techniques felt great, it was ruined by the non-stop chatter. Sadly, I have not and will not return. It just not worth $75.\n",

      "       I discovered Art of Massage by using a discount voucher. Was that the best deal of my life? That would be a \"yes\". I go to Trisha, who is a neuromuscular therapist, targeting areas that may be causing problems, while at the same time, giving me a spa experience. Serene environment in a beautiful old colonial house. It's warm and cozy with plenty of free parking. She uses a water-dispersable organic oil that is not greasy. I leave it on so my skin can absorb it without any messy feeling of oil. Wonderful touches like warm towels to wipe the oil off your back, warm cushions under your neck to loosen up the muscles before she works on them, soothing music, even a bottle of water as you leave. You can book online or call for an appointment. Trisha is very responsive to my needs, remembers I am cold-natured, so my table is always toasty warm when I get on it. I recently had some back problems and normally, I would've ended up seeing a chiropractor for a couple of months, but after one visit with Trisha, I felt so good, only a little soreness. I went back today and she took care of that. Honestly, the best massages I've ever gotten.\n",

Talk about difficult to relax. I dizzily walked up the stairs, waited in cushy chairs (I think was in a hallway), then transferred to a cozy, dimly lit room. This space is in a shared building, which made it feel a bit cramped. However, once you're getting the massage, it's no different if you're in a large spa. The things I liked about this place was as follows: no membership and can book online. The fee for service is $75 for any massage. While there are other places with a lower fee for Swedish, they're on par for their deep tissue.\n",

I used to have a really good therapist when I lived in California so I was quite pleased to find Art of Massage here in Charlotte. The practice is small, as the other reviewer mentioned, but I didn't care as the ambiance is quiet and peaceful. The customer service is wonderful and I like that they're close to a lot of other businesses on Selwyn. You can get a massage here and get lunch at Reid's or Nolan Kitchen. Or treat yourself to wine and chocolates at Petit Philippe, which is another great local spot! My favorite aspect of the massages here is that the therapist will blend techniques. I like having a mix of pressure point, shiatsu, and deep tissue massage. Trisha, Christine, and Erin will find your problem points and make them melt away :) I highly recommend them.\n",

      "       Small, relatively new practice run by three women owners who are the massage therapists. Great location on the second floor of the house next to Selwyn pub with plenty of parking. At this time there is only one room within the practice, so if you have a particular date in mind, be sure to call early for an appointment. Inside was very clean and quiet for a Saturday afternoon session. They have aromatherapy, candles, soap, and lotion items for sale in front area of the practice. You will be charged by the amount of time you are on the table, which allows them to use multiple types of massage depending on your need (Swedish, Deep Tissue, Hot Stone, Thai, etc). They even do the type where they walk on your back if you need a seriously deep massage (which brought visions of the Charlie's Angels movie to mind). I have had a massage by two of the owners and both were very good. Felt quite relaxed and comfortable talking with them about pressure needed, sore spots, etc. Massage lasted the full hour, which is different from most places who say it's an hour but then only actually have you on the table for 50 minutes. I highly recommend this practice and would love to see them expand to a larger space as they are currently exploring.\n",

The midwives treated me ever so kindly and never seemed bothered by questions or concerns. I loved that they actually listened to me and valued my opinions and beliefs as a person. My birth went so beautifully, and it is nice to have lovely memories of such a special time in our lives. It was also restful to experience the first few days of my son's life at home with our family instead of lying around in a hospital. I have since been back for well-woman care and have also had terrific experiences with them. The midwives are thorough and truly take their time to answer your questions and listen.

      "       There is a lot of love for the midwife center here and much of it is hard won and well deserved. Their space is beautiful and modern. Most staff are kind and professional. I appreciate their holistic, personalized approach to healthcare - (they've asked me some thoughtful, out-of-the-box questions and do take interest in the whole picture of your health) - as well as their progressive lean and focus on healthcare accessibility. I was a patient here for over a year and I can tell you that all of these things are the real deal. The weaknesses of this practice - in my layperson opinion - are as follows: 1) Limited scope. They aren't an OB/GYN, and can't really take the place of one. As one of the nurses very snippily told me, they \"don't practice medicine\", sounding like I had walked into an Applebee's and asked them to operate on my foot. They practice nursing, I get that - I only expect a medical provider to, you know, help me, and not make my issue worse. Lots of folks do prefer midwives to the traditional MDs &amp; DOs, and I can appreciate that, but their ability to diagnose and treat is much more limited than they advertise. For me, this meant visits with three different providers, a misdiagnosis, unnecessary meds, lots of invasive stuff, hundreds of dollars of unnecessary tests, and one sad patient with no answers. I wish they had recognized when something was maybe a little beyond their scope and just referred me out on the front end, saving me a whole bunch of misery. As with most things in life, YMMV. A limited scope of practice might be okay for you! If you're the picture of health and just want to pop in for your annual or grab a birth control script, AND if you're already connected with a solid gynecologist to see for any real problems, this facility might very well meet your needs. Because - my next point: 2) Continuity of care is lacking. They suck at referrals. I was initially told that they have a select few GYNs in the community with whom they work closely and collaboratively. But when I actually needed this referral, I was sent five+ pages of basically an indecipherable, broken wall of text and told I could self-refer to \"that clinic at Magee\" but that I didn't really \"need\" to. How helpful is that? 3) Pretty unprofessional billing/recordkeeping practices - I've gotten multiple bills addressed to the wrong person for my own care and have gotten bills with handwriting and white out on them. Their EMR/portal with Maternity Neighborhood is pretty poor quality and I've seen another patient's medical records mixed in with my own! A little concerning. Ultimately, my health concern was promptly addressed and treated at my first visit with an MD elsewhere and I don't intend on returning to this clinic. I do feel this place has a lot of potential and I respect all the positive reviews, but to me the concerns outweigh the benefits. I'd rather go to a more professional clinic with a higher capacity for service.\n",

The midwives are delightful and they make this process very easy. They provide you with tons of information when you first start coming, but are readily available if you have any additional questions. I love that I can access my chart online; which included test results, appointment notes, and our correspondence back and forth. They're also able to send me scripts if needed via the website.

      "       After experiencing the care and delivery of a child through a hospital and doctor I was desperate to try something different. I had heard about the Midwife Center through a friend and when we decided to have another child we went to an orientation. I liked the warm environment and all the information they shared and immediately decided we would give them a try during our pregnancy. I can say that the experience was nothing but good. We met several of the midwives through our care and they always gave us their full attention. They answered all our questions and offered excellent advice for any items that came up. I really liked that during your appointment you see the midwife for your entire visit. You are not processed by a nurse first or after. We were allowed to bring our family to each appointment and they were treated as part of the birth team and not interruptions. I was also very impressed with their front office and billing staff, both were courteous and extremely helpful. At no point during my pregnancy did we feel that we weren't being 100% cared for by all the staff and their enthusiasm for our journey was very contagious. We delivered at the Center and it was a fantastic experience. I can't speak highly enough about it and I am so glad that I made the choice to go natural at the Center with the care of the midwife and nurse. We had a follow up visit from the nurse and she was very thorough and again answered all our questions and offered great advice. I would recommend the Midwives to all women looking for outstanding care. I especially endorse their facilities as a birthing center for those looking for an alternative to the hospital environment. (For those who want to stick to the hospital you can still use their great services.)\n",

      "       Let me start of by saying that I go here for well-woman care only so far. No babies just yet! So I can't comment on the quality of their birth services, although their statistics are quite impressive. As a new client, it was tough for me to find parking for the center -- on-street around the center was all full. If I had known that there was a lot I could park in that would have been HIGHLY useful information! So -- a quick tip: If you go to the Midwife Center you can run in and just inside the door are parking passes for a nearby lot. GET ONE! The Midwife Center is in a converted row house and you have to climb the stairs to get to the reception area. When I walked in, I was clearly confused, but someone downstairs was kind enough to point me in the right direction. The women that work at The Midwife Center were friendly and receptive when I went in for my appointment. There was paperwork to be filled out -- although a nice touch is that it is all available online so you can do it ahead of time instead of going to your appointment 30 minutes early and racking your brain trying to remember every detail of family history. As a new patient, I was interviewed and seen by a Nurse Practicioner, and she was friendly, professional, and seemed interested in EVERY part of my health -- which I appreciated. They seem to focus on health for the whole person, not just one area. I really look forward to my care here throughout the years!\n",

Through both, I have encountered a huge number of personal challenges and complications, and have been absolutely impressed and comforted by the way they have cared for me and provided the most amazing level of support and medical expertise.

With a warm environment and a super caring knowledgeable staff who are accustomed to assisting families through that big deal known as childbirth, I feel very comfortable in the competent hands of the midwives. Since their specialty is caring for pregnant women, I think that they are more attentive of subtle gynecological problems, as even minor problems for the average woman can be serious problems to one with child. On Friday afternoons, they offer cheap and/or free services to those without insurance on a tight budget in cooperation with a project of AdiagoHealth; an excellent opportunity to get tested for STIs and an annual check-up.\n",

All the providers try to find solutions to your pain problems and got me back to doing things I love. While The Pain Center is more conservative, it is appreciated as I was looking for other alternatives to pain management other than just pain medication. The back office staff are awesome and everyone there seems to know your name which makes the experience more personal. I recommend this place to anyone!!!\n",

      "       Been going here for a few years now, and never had any issues. In fact, they've gone above and beyond several times when I was experiencing other health issues. They work with your schedule to accommodate you early or late, send out reminders by phone and email, and have forms in a secure patient portal you can complete beforehand. Richard and Alicia are awesome Nurse Practioners; personable, professional, and care about how you're doing (same goes for Jade at the front desk). As for the negative reviews here, I can't speak to the patient's experience but based on my years of going here I'm surprised and would remind everyone that there's always 2 sides to the story. I have NEVER once felt that TPC or its providers have pushed meds - in fact they look constantly for alternatives that will work for you if you're willing to try them. Dr Turley was recommended to me by my neurosurgeon and my PCP - and he is great. Have had a few injections from him to manage pain and he's thorough, helpful, informative, and caring throughout. As with any service provider, be up front and honest (ask questions, get things in writing if needed) and you'll get the great service you deserve. Practice the Golden Rule and life will reciprocate the goodness.\n",

      "       Wow... Live and learn. If you are planning on coming to this place please use caution. I am totally blown away after 3+ years of coming to this place I have never been treated like this. Left hand has no clue what the right hand is doing. One visit I was told this procedure was my only option, the following visit clueless to what's going on and when asked they replied that procedure in no longer an option. Mass confusion is the only way I can describe this place. Today I go in for another visit to have a procedure done and to no surprise they were again not on the same page. All I was asking is to please stop the pain in my back. Good look if you go there. Interesting they replied to my review and act like they care. Dont be fooled, it's always been about the money, they like to use big works like CARE. Tried calling the number, leave a message and someone will get back to you... WHAT A JOKE...\n",

      "       So update... I spoke to the \"Patient Relations\" department to find out what needed to be done to rectify this issue. However, in order to work with me they asked that I remove Richard's last name from the review. I obliged and removed it. They told me that I would have to go back to the same location and see my normal doctor before they would do anything else with me. I had already stated I no longer felt comfortable going back to that location but they gave me no other option. A team member called to schedule my appointment and although I wasn't happy about going back to the same location I was at least glad that I would only have to go once more and then be transferred to a different location. The day before my appointment the manager of the patient relations department called me back and stated that in order to be seen by anyone in their practice I would have to 1. Remove the negative comments in my review, or 2. Change my review to 3 stars or more; or they refused to see me at all. Talk about unethical, I have way too much self respect to let someone force me to do something that isn't right. I cancelled my appointment and asked for the discharge paperwork so that I could find a new facility. The headache of finding another doctor and time and money it takes is well worth not dealing with this place ever again. I stand by my words that are 100% true and honest as I would have NO reason to lie or falsify my information as I get nothing from posting this (other than hopefully warn others about this place).\n",

      "       I love TPC! They are knowledgeable people who also listen. I have been seeing Richard Smiehorowski, NP at TPC since June 2013 for a reason. He is honest and has a great bedside manner. He has always given me my options and respected my choices. He listens to me and if he doesn't have the answer he always gets me an answer quickly. Over the years and changes to my health, I have always felt he has my back and truly seeks to find what is best for me and my individual needs. He is funny and I have truly enjoyed my monthly visits. With the ever changing guidelines and procedures imposed by the DEA on patients and the medical staff that cares for them in response to the \"opioid crisis\", Richard has always taken the time to explain to me what is happening and how it will affect me. He truly cares while still maintaining a balance of professionalism and good-natured humor which I appreciate so much. He has made me feel not so alone in the face of serious, debilitating illness. He has been an absolute angel. I have a friend with a very rare condition who also goes to TPC but a different location. There are no real protocols in place to treat her condition because of its rarity. She had told me about a particular practitioner with whom she had a negative experience. I immediately told her to schedule her next appointment with Richard. She did and she has never looked back. Richard found a doctor in the TPC family who has experience with a procedure that shows promise as a treatment for her condition. She has begun the treatment and, while she will need to endure the procedure many times, the doctor Richard recommended to her has been amazing. She feels cared for and listened to by both Richard and her new TPC doctor. That sense of security is priceless. Thank you Richard, Dr. Turley, ALL of the medical professionals and support staff of TPC!\n",

      "       Treat you like an assembly line, overweight long haired woman at the front desk apparently doesn't know how to smile whatsoever, unhelpful and pushes everything off to another department or person. People do not not seem happy to work there. My doctor friend said they would push epidurals and pain meds because they make no money off of trigger point injections. That's exactly what they did. Did not offer trigger point injections went straight to epidurals. I pointed out that we should start with trigger point injections first then we will consider something more aggressive. Know your options know your body. You cannot just take the advice of a doctor these days as they are governed by insurance, pharmaceutical companies and protocol whether it applies or not.\n",

      "       They used to be sympathetic &amp; attentive to the patient's needs, but now they have become an assembly line corporate run hell house.. I am trying to relocate to another state. These jerks have been uncooperative to the point of being deliberately sabotaging the move. They have continually changed their policies, and have NEVER put ONE change in writing. I never know what to expect when I walk through the door now. I will admit Dr. Turley is very good at administering the injections. It is a pity they do not work for me though. I always refuse(d) anesthetic when getting the injections. I dislike being incapacitated, so I refuse any drugs that get me high. I have been dealing with lawyers, and need to keep a clear head. Dr. Turley did a great job administering the injections. I found no real need to use any strong anesthesia at all. Turley is just that good, but the injections only work for about 5 days, after the pain from the injections goes away. When cold air hits my back after the injections, it feels like someone put a branding iron on my back, so they just do not work for me. I am sure Dr. Turley is probably following \"corporate policy\". I don't know. Lately these people have been pulling another new violation to their rules out of their ass every time I visit. I am looking desperately for another provider, in Colorado and or Arizona. TPC is NOT cooperating with the other pain management doctors, and has been adding an new transgression to my records every visit, making the move all but impossible. I do not care. I will endure whatever it takes to get as far away from these a--holes as possible. They have gone from heroes to zeros in my book. I will contact the medical board and a patient's advocacy groups, and their lawyers with my concerns. TPC was wonderful to me in the beginning, and then they stared doing less, and less. It was still tolerable, up until I tried to leave. Now they have become total asses. They run everyone through like they are inoculating cattle now, with zero regard for any patient's special needs, or extraordinary situations. I have NEVER run out of my meds, early. I have never diverted my meds, lost my meds or even had a bottle with the doctor's name on it go missing. I hold a very serious bond of trust with my doctor(s) that I will keep both of us out of any trouble. That bond works both ways, and when it ceases to do so, it is time for me to move on. I cannot recommend this establishment to anyone anymore, and anyone who I did refer to TPC, please contact me, if you wish to leave too. I can think of at least 15 referrals, I made. I am very careful who I will refer to anyone. Anyone with dubious character, I will not even acknowledge anything about anything to. That is part of that trust I like to keep between me and my doctors. If I cannot trust them to honor letters they signed, and agreements they made, making changes on a whim, with no protocol in writing, it shows me I am going to a bunch of money hungry tyrants, with no regard for helping do anything but make the payments on their new BMWs.\n",

Not only is she patient, informative, and caring, I feel completely safe when I come to Martina knowing that my skin is in GREAT hands. She is completely transparent isn't aggressive like most places where they ask/force you to buy their products at the end. In addition to her amazing facials, she gives you all the tools and tips you need to get your skin exactly where you want it to be. I have referred MANY of my friends and I will continue to refer people. Her office is peaceful, relaxing and spotless, like a spa. Do yourself a favour and Go.\n",

I would highly recommend this place for a facial for anyone looking for a very high-quality facial with excellent customer service.I walked away feeling impressed and very happy with the entire experience.

Martina's professional manner and clarity really put me at ease. She was efficient without being brisk, explaining what she was doing as she went and making sure i knew what to expect. Her extractions were incredibly thorough--she really spent a LONG time making sure she got every pore. A week and a half out, my skin looks amazing. I'm not sure where The Skin Klinic falls on the scale of spa-to-clinic. The room is comfortable and quiet, and I was very relaxed when I was left alone with the steamer or with a mask after the microdermabrasion. On the other hand, Martina really made me feel like she knew what she was doing, and when she was actually working on my skin, the vibe was more clinical. I would definitely go back and recommend this place to others.\n",

      "       I purchased a Groupon for a mini facial, and the services I ended up receiving was well over what I had expected. Initially I was very apprehensive as i could't get in touch with her to book an appointment and have had similar bad experiences through groupon before. I did eventually get my appointment, and when I arrived she was very welcoming and takes the time to understand your skin type and problem areas so she can craft the facial accordingly. The facial took a little over an hour and included extractions, light therapy and microdermabrasion as i was suffering from dark spots and acne. My appointment was about 3 weeks ago so I've waited to write this review until i could see what the actual results were. My skin has cleared up almost completely and there is a visible difference with my dark spots. She gave me a few tips to try with my diet that would help with the acne recurring along with the treatment. I will probably be booking another appointment soon and hopefully will have a similar pleasant experience. ps. This happened while i was there, and although It didn't affect me it's worth mentioning. During my appointment another customer who seemed to be a regular arrived and martina had to send her away because they had a scheduling mixup. Take this with a grain of salt as it could have in fact been the client's mistake.\n",

      "       Got a coupon from Groupon for a glow express facial. The woman was very nice at first, I enjoyed my facial and she did a good job. However she offered to set up another appointment for a consultation as I was genuinely interested in the products she had to offer. Right before the appointment day, she cancelled on me saying she had a doctors appointment. I was very pissed as it was a short notice and I cancelled my initial plans to get this appointment after two weeks, so I told her to not worry about it anymore and I will ask for some other time in the future. I text her again after a couple of days asking for an appointment and she completely ignores all my text messages and calls. I would say its better not to pretend to be so nice in my face if you don't even treat me right after. I would not recommend this place. She is only nice for the time you're there. OK for a one time facial. However its difficult to find as its located in the basement of a clinic without any notice board outside indicating so.\n",

      "       i purchased the groupon for a glow express facial . it was a big discount ($39 instead of over $100) but since it was an \"express\" facial i thought it would be 30-45 mins ; it actually ended up being over an hour which was great . i was a bit apprehensive about the word \"klinic\" not because of the spelling but because i was hoping that although it wasnt a spa that it would still be relaxing and not too ... \"clinical\" ;) turns out i was totally in luck . martina was very warm, relaxed and welcoming, and she seemed genuinely interested in my skin . it was a very nice space, and the atmosphere in the room where she performed the facial was well-appointed, comforting and serene . she didnt try to upsell me on any extra treatments, didnt push any products on me, and in fact gave me a recommendation for something that i can buy at the drugstore . it was so refreshing to deal with someone who was helpful and honest it was one of the best parts of the experience ! as for the actual facial, i have to admit that this was the first one ive ever had, but i am a pretty critical gal in general so despite my lack of experience if she werent a pro i would have noticed . it was, from what i understand, a typical but well-executed routine of cleansing, steam, extractions, mask, toning and moisturising . i have read in other reviews of facials that some people are put-off by having the esthetician leave the room during parts of the treatment . this didnt bother me at all ; she left the room twice for 10 minutes each time ; during the steam and during the mask, and i found it very nice and peaceful . i actually think i would find it awkward to have the esthetician stay in the room in silence with you for 10 minutes ! all in all, this was a really great experience for me and i already bought my sister the same deal as a gift ! i am hoping to return in the future and will recommend martina to anyone looking for a kind and skilled esthetician :)\n",

Myself and my three kids had an appointment. April scheduled it to where the Dr wasn't overbooked. There was no one else in the waiting room with us, as soon as we were done filling out the paperwork, we went right back. The office is beautiful! Also I have a 4 and 5 year old and they went out of there way to make sure the kids were entertained. Dr. Trobough himself was very friendly and thorough. My favorite person that sealed the deal, making this office my family dentist was ALLY!! Oh she is soo good at her job and what she does! she made my little ones feel comfortable, and they aren't scared of the dentist. So glad I got to experience excellent customer service and care at your office. See you soon!\n",

      "       I've been seeing Dr. Trobough for over 20 years. He has been a great dentist to me and is highly professional and personable. Always does a great job and is honest with his recommendations and fees. He'll take the conservative route and try to help you save money where he can. If he makes other recommendations he give you options and always explain why he's making those suggestions. But there's never any pressure. I lost connection with him for 2 years and was able to track him down. Now he has a lovely new office in Summerlin. I am back seeing him again as a patient. His wonderful staff Nicole is with him after all these years! In addition, he has a new staff that are all so wonderful. If you're looking for an honest, personable and professional dentist...this is your doctor. Stop now and call. You'll feel thankful that you made him your dentist. Check out their new office, nicely decorated and inviting!\n",

I was terrified never having to have this done before but Dr. Trobough was extremely gentle, I didn't even feel him numbing me! He explained every step of what he was doing and his assistant Nicole was attentive and kept checking that I was ok the whole time. The whole staff is wonderful and my fillings aren't noticeable and feel like nothing was even done! His Hygienist Ali had cleaned my teeth prior and was the best cleaning I ever had very thorough and gentle!! Nancy makes the scheduling, checking in and out process a total breeze!! I HIGHLY recommend this office, especially if you are terrified of procedures like I am!\n",

Patience was there and I big time needed it considering that I am a hard patient when it comes to sitting on that dentistry chair that i used to hate and not stopping every once a while for a break, lol. he was extremely understanding and not at all bothered until I realized that I am way more comfortable and happy on that chair than I used to be with any other Doctor. Moreover, the team, each one of them were very very sweet, smiling, energetic, professional, and they know what they are doing, that's for sure.

The second time I donated blood, I must have not eaten enough prior to going so I got light headed toward the end. The employee working knew exactly what to do and gave me an ice pack to cool me down. Very pleased with the protectiveness and friendliness of the staff.\n",

      "       I am the type of person that likes to contribute to the world - even if it is kind of passively on such issues such as donating blood. I have a literal bucket list item where I want to donate blood on a regular basis for at least 5 years. So here I am in year 1, four regular donations in (donated previously, but not regularly). Physically, I've been all lover the board with donating blood - I've done everything from walk out the door feeling like nothing happened to passing out in the chair. To say that I've had time to figure out what my body likes and does not like is an understatement. So what does my body like? It wants a nice meal 2 hours before donating and plenty of water leading up to that donation time. During the donation it likes one bottle of water, and maybe a snack (which, BTW, is free). The staff is always nice and courteous with me. When I passed out, they helped me and helped me figure out what went wrong (I hadn't eaten in 8+ hours prior to donating). When I donate without issue, still super nice. I took my girlfriend last time and she had complications (didn't pass out, but very, very close) and they were super nice to her as well. If the free water, soda, popcorn, and snacks aren't enough for you... then you can also earn points to purchase things (Hero Reward Program) - free ice-cream, free movie tickets, free clothing, etc. And on top of that they regularly have by-the-day freebies. Last time it was a free pint of ice-cream. Prior to that it was a special entry to win a car being given away to people who donate blood (closed to everyone else). There is a slew of different options of donation too. I do the whole blood which is the traditional method where they just take a pint and use it as a whole or separate it out into certain parts that they need. I've considered also going back and donating to one of the more specialized donations too (i.e. plasma, platelet, etc) since those have different time requirements than whole. Blood (whole blood):Every 56 days Platelets: Every 7 days, up to 24 times / year Plasma: Every 28 days, up to 13 times / year Double Red Cells: Every 112 days, up to 3 times / year The whole process takes about an hour. Donation, the actual needle in your arm, takes about 15 minutes. The rest is answering questions, checking your iron levels, and recovery time where you get to eat snacks in the waiting room (making sure you don't have a negative response to the donation before driving away). So seriously, go donate! You never know who it will help - it could even help you!!!!\n",

She always bruises my arm.\" \"The donor chairs are much more comfortable than the lobby chairs at Jiffy Lube.\" This is such a specialized service provider that it's hard to review it, but it's a good one. They haven't hurt me or done me wrong. So, it's where I repay my debt to society. No, no, not like community service or some court mandated repayment thing... Five years ago I received almost 8 units of blood after a massive surgery, basically keeping me alive, so *this* is how I pay back my debt of gratitude. (Plus, the chairs here are so much more comfy than the Jiffy Lube lobby chairs.)\n",

      "       I have loved donating at United Blood services and planned to do so every quarter for the rest of my life until I met the disrespectful jerk employee here that raised his voice to me repeatedly \"Let me finish!!!\", I couldn't carry a conversation or get a word in edge wise with this bully idiot. I had the displeasure of meeting that abrasive employee at this location, AND I WILL NEVER AGAIN DONATE TO UNITED BLOOD SERVICES BECAUSE OF IT. I am still stunned by this male phlebotomists/nurse whatever he was, his demeanor and attitude, seemed to be that of a low life ghetto thug. United, you should look into this guy, he will repel more donors if you do not remove him from donor contact. Side note: Your bait and switch tactics really bothered me, I was donating anyway, so I wasn't really expecting to get things, but don't send out emails telling people that they'll get a $10 Amazon gift card and then tell them they can't have one when they get there, this will also repel donors. I hope this is location specific as the lack of professionalism was appalling. Shame, it was a good and generous commitment on my part that helped the community. Now every time I hear that blood supplies are low, I will know why.\n",

Now with the interview process moving to the computer-even able to complete online at home before appt-it makes the time to donate much shorter! I've always thought that the interview to donate-though extremely important-always took longer than the actual donation! I like the appt reminders and I very rarely have to wait. They also accept walk-ins of there's an open chair, so I'd you're in the area, stop in. The feeling of donating blood to help others is my greatest reward! (Hubby likes donating here too!)\n",

Ian McLeod doesn't care and cannot even answer a phone message after 4 months of calls and at least 15 messages. He just doesn't care and can't be bothered.\n",

Dr. Anastasi was prompt and didn't keep me waiting. He even gave me tips on where I could save on my Rx. I have recommended him to my friends and family and I would recommend him to you as well.

      "       I met Dr. McCoy today for some back pain I was having. He took the time to explain to me what was going on inside my body. It's been awhile since any dr. has given me more than 5 minutes time so having Dr. McCoy spend about 30 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong with me and explaining the root cause of my back pain was very refreshing. He recommended a plan A and then told me that he didn't need to see me again if everything worked out. Wow...my last Dr. wanted to see me back even if I was fine...which always means more time wasted in a waiting room and a copay only to find out...well..that I'm fine. Dr. McCoy also took the time to explain plan B to me as well. Although if I need to go plan B route, I\"ll need to come see him to make sure the Plan A isn't helping. All in all, I have to say that I LOVE University Sports Medicine. You can't find Drs anymore who will take the time to truly explain what's going on. So...thank you Dr. McCoy. P.S. I have been there in the past to see Alice for my annual exam. She's pretty darn amazing too.\n",

      "       The worst doctor's office I've ever dealt with. I give this place 1 star because the PA, Alice Peterson, is excellent. I went to Dr. McCoy for a chronically painful hip (osteoarthritis). He sent me to Physical Therapy, even though I'd already been once before. PT was excruciating, so I returned to McCoy. He gave me serious narcotics (too strong) and got me an MRI. A week after the MRI, I'd heard nothing back. Called the office and found out the doctor hadn't even read it yet. When he did, he saw a labral tear in the cartilege and sent me to an arthroscopic speciatist. That guy told me that there was no point fixing the tear, I needed a hip replacement. So had to wait for an appointment with good hip surgeon and then wait for surgery date. I needed a pre-surgical physical and blood tests, which also were ordered through these people. Again, Alice was great. I had everything done 2 weeks before they were due. Again, no response, no feedback on tests. On the Thursday before they were due, I called and was told that they would be marked \"urgent\". Today, the Monday the results were due, I called my surgeon -- no results had been faxed. Turns out they'd been faxing USM the previous Thursday and today too. I called USM and they told me they would mark my request 'urgent'. Ha! Ha! I told them they'd already done that and that I could come down and hand carry the results to my surgeon. I was very irate. They put me on hold, apologized, told me the results had been faxed that day and would be faxed again. We'll see. The front desk has been consistently rude and incompetent. Once I said I needed an appointment in 4-6 weeks. The front desk person said, \"46 weeks\"? I moved to AZ recently and had this office recommended to me. I will NEVER return.\n",

      "       As a sickly and regular patient/customer, I really think I can review a hospital, but must concede the great diversity and relativity of experiences within a hospital among the diseased, injured,... dying etc. There's so much going on in a hospital perhaps one can only relate their own experiences. I had a pretty basic surgical experience here, which was a Vascular Decompression surgery for trigeminal neuralgia. Basically they cut away skin and muscle from my temporal and occipital bones, drilled a hole in my skull and placed padding between the fifth cranial nerve and some 'offending' artery. The surgeon did what appears at this time to be a great job. My scar is very small compared to patients of other neurosurgeons, so my review here, is an attempt at an accurate account of my hospital stay and experience. The waiting room and time were fine for my experience, but the negative aspects would be the lack of pain management, uncomfortable recovery, and the bossy nurses. Currently, one week after my surgery I am managing my pain with Tylenol and whisky. I ran out of oxycodone today and apparently they do not refill it after 4:30pm. It must be standard operating procedure in the hospital business to supply the patient/customer with no more than one week of pain medication after surgery, which has been the case here. In my opinion, it is immoral. There are 1,000s of people out there in pain that cannot get relief. After dozens of unrelated surgeries, I anticipate it, personally, but potential patients/customers here should be forewarned of UPMC's incompetent system. My suggestion is whisky or vodka; although nausea inducing, and disorienting, with the proper moderation they allow for some relief and sleep. We patients/customers, get treated like inmates or something. It's degrading. In the Operating Room, they didn't talk to me very much even though I was asking questions and put in the really painful burning anesthetic into my left arm's I.V. line. Upon awakening, I remember a lot of pain, disorientation and vomiting. It was extremely uncomfortable. Usually, one awakens with pain and thirst, but here I remember them asking all kinds of questions while my head hurt and I was vomiting. They also had in a urethral catheter, which was very uncomfortable. I was able to get them to take it out only after begging for a long time. One thing I hate in a hospital stay, is a urethral catheter. I didn't need one, and resent the fact I woke up with one in. I also woke up with an extra I.V. line in my inner elbow area. I always request that my I.V.s be placed away from joints as they bruise the veins when I move, but obviously, this request was ignored in the O.R. It would take them over 24 hours to remove it. The hospital room was nice and the nurses a bit bossy, which I guess was protocol for a neurosurgery patient. They kept making me look around, tell the date and push my feet and hands into the air. All I wanted to do was sleep. At any rate it took them a long time to inject me with pain medication and remove extra I.V. input lines. I was nauseous and could only eat Jello, which they readily supplied effectively. So, now I'm still sore and at home, but doing a lot better. Seemed like an effective hospital and the associated school has a great reputation- one of the best in the world, in fact. I've heard that the other hospitals in Pittsburgh have better food and rooms however.\n",

      "       UPMC is truly world class medicine - it just is - speaking from experience as a patient AND as a healthcare worker. UPMC makes up a whole hospital system that has several main hospitals and out laying clinics in Pittsburgh and around the world. They have hospitals in Italy, Ireland, Egypt, etc... and in Pittsburgh alone, looking at Hillman Cancer Center, Shadyside, Presby, etc... its fantastic. I have worked at Shadyside and Presby - I can't speak ill on either one. Presby is truly a world of its own, though. Its *massive* and is comprised of MANY intensive care units - neuro/trauma, CCU, surgical ICU, cardiothoracic ICU, liver transplant ICU, medical ICU, etc... The population at presby is VERY sick - they take on clients that no one else will touch because of surgeries being high risk, etc.. and they give patients a chance. The nurses are EXCEPTIONAL, very smart, very well educated and very on top of things, if not overworked and understaffed which is more of a state of the nation, not so much a UPMC specific problem. But when nursing is understaffed, patient care suffered and patient satisfaction drops. The docs are also really excellent. I only worked in the intensive care units there, but I can honestly say that I would send my family there in a heart beat. Parking is really expensive, they do have vallet services which is great for the ER needs as well. The cafeteria is really big and on the top floor. Presby also bridges over to the eye and ear institute and montifore hospital. They are a level 1 trauma center, heart, lung, liver transplant center... When I was there, they were not a burn center, however. Really sick? Need great care? - Go to UPMC. I would move back across the country to get care in Pittsburgh - thats how much faith I have in their medical practices.\n",

      "       Who wants to go to the hospital? Yay! Well, not me! Okay, so that makes me a kill-joy! As I said in my review of Magee Women's Hospital, no one really wants to go. But when you do have to go, it's good to know that you will receive excellent care. I was in the ER here recently as an outpatient. I wiped out on my bicycle (yes, I was wearing my helmet!) and sprained my ankle.* I was taken to the ER here, and even though I had a bit of wait--I was not a life or death case--I received respectful, kind care from the staff here. People who work in an ER are under a lot of stress, but everyone here was wonderful from the nurse to the doctor to the X-ray technician. The follow-up care was good too. I spent a week on crutches, then I was given the boot after my first follow-up visit. They referred me to a sports-medicine therapist and gave me suggested exercises to do. I went last week to check the progress and the doctor was pleased with the healing process. UPMC Hospitals have given me great care throughout the years. *Please read my review on \"Kindness\" about the nice couple who came to my aid.\n",

      "       I really like my doctor here and so far have put up with the rude admin...which seems be legendary going by other reviews here. After my recent experience, I'm now considering switching doctors because I just can deal with the admin staff. The day before an overseas holiday I lost my anxiety pills, which of course put me in a panic. I called the staff telling them I urgently needed to get a refill. I made several attempts to reach her until they told me she had gone home for the day. At one point a receptionist had the nerve to make light of my situation and actually laughed at me. Despite the urgency, they never bothered to speak to the doctor until the next day. I literally got a call from my pharmacist as I was checking in for my flight. I had to borrow medication from a friend for my trip. If you have mental illness I would strongly suggest finding another clinic.\n",

      "       I have been reading reviews and thought I'd post my own. I became a patient at this clinic about 5 years ago and before I start mumbling about modern decor and rude or friendly smiles and candies at the front desk let's cut to chase: The MEDICAL TEAM IS OUTSTANDING. My family practitioner, Dr. Charles King is truly a genuinely sincere, knowledgeable and excellent doctor. I never feel rushed. I do feel extremely confident that all records are recorded and organized and there is a great deal of due diligence and care that the team puts into every appointment, I have to say in general, where on earth do you get to confidentially e-mail your doctor and have a one-on-one response back (always within the same day from my experience!!!??) This is health care with a gold bar raised in my eyes, and this service in particular has me throwing medical accolade-confetti all over the place. As for reviews of reception staff being rude, well, I treat people as I would like to be treated. I come in on time or a little early, I at most in 5 years, have waited 15 minutes for my apt (this only happened one time) and yes, while it may be a little confusing for some new-comers as to why the ladies at the desk are not handling your cards personally (they are booking apt and taking calls) the automated system to log in is smack dab in front of you and once when I had trouble the lady was polite and helpfully answered my issues logging in. I needed counselling outside of my doctors care, and my doctor happily reffered me to services on-site!! I am happy to be starting within a month of inquiring about them! There's an on-site pharmacy, easy to get to location right in Liberty Village, and there is green P parking literally across the road. For Toronto, I don't know how much more convenient medical care and access you can get. For those interested, they also offer physiotherapy, and there is baby care or something of the sort (sorry not a parent but i know they accommodate people with children there) Also, it is barrier-free design and yes, the design is stunningly modern, clean bright and refreshing. Ok, there, had to chime in after reading such negative reviews! I am a proud fan of the Village Family Health Team and only wish that in the future, they perhaps expand and include more holistic modalities in combination with their traditional practice, as I am forced to go to King Liberty Health Team around the block for naturopathic advice. It would be beneficial to the business to keep customers in one spot, just a suggestion, but space might be an issue unless they acquire the whole building! lol Overall, LOVE the Village Health team and all the staff, Thank you for providing us with care and appointments on time and on schedule in such a busy hectic city !! Kudos To your health~ !! -Magdalena\n",

      "       I was cruising Yelp, as dorks like me do, and I came across my doctor's office, Village Family Health Team. I am shocked by the three star average. This is by far my best experience with a family doctor in Toronto I've ever had. My husband needed a family doctor fast when relocating from SF to TO and he came across this place accepting patients. Honestly, he would have taken any crap clinic, but we got extremely lucky here. He liked his doc, M Shah MD, so much that I made the switch to her from my other doctor when I was 8 months pregnant. Anyone who has had a baby knows that adding more appointments to that nutty schedule of being poked, prodded, felt up and looked inside is bordering on insane. But, I'm sure glad I did it. My family of three now all goes here and we couldn't be happier with our experiences. Things that make this place extra special: +Compound pharmacy onsite +Well Baby Groups for your little one, where they get vaccinated and you learn with other families +Nurse Practitioners onsite in case you have something urgent and your doc isn't in +Hand sanitizer everywhere +Genuinely kind people If an apple a day isn't working for you, and they're accepting patients, I highly recommend Village Family Health Team.\n",

      "       I have been a patient here since they opened and have only had positive experiences. My doctor is attentive, compassionate and knowledgeable. I've personally never had issues with rude admin staff in the time I've been a patient here. The most I have ever waited at an appointment was 10 minutes. I'm always amazed at how well organized they are. I'm also able to see my doctor quickly, typically that day if needed or a few days after my initial call if it isn't urgent. I am also able to communicate with my doctor via a secure online system for questions I have, she typically responds within 24 hours. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place and my doctor. I've recommended it to my husband and friends, we've all had similar experiences. I can't help but wonder if some of these reviews are confusing this clinic with another local clinic? There is a local clinic with the name of the street this clinic is on, I was a patient there before fvh opened and the service from both staff and dr was horrible. FVH also takes the time to reach out to their patients for feedback on suggested improvements. I feel valued and appreciated here. FVH is AMAZING, best doctor and clinic I've ever had.\n",

It doesn't matter to them if you work in Liberty Village (and thus spend the majority of the waking time there) making it most convenient location to have a family physician in, rather than around your residence, used mostly for sleeping.

I've never had to wait long in the waiting room for my appointments to start, they've actually all started on time. The doctors are so knowledgeable, that most of my appointments have ended early, as the doctors knew right away what was wrong, and were able to fix me up quickly. They also have an app with allows patients to communicate with their doctor without having to make an appointment - so convenient if you only want a prescription refilled, you can even tell the doctor which pharmacy to contact. Totally eliminates the need to make an appointment and go in just to ask the doctor for a prescription refill. Will definitely be staying with this clinic. I'd recommend to anyone!\n",

Next I was told I have no business knowing anything about my sons medical needs . STOP RIGHT THERE. My son is the one and only thing I care about in this world and I will now and always fight until the bitter end and no as much as humanly possible about all that concerns him. If he has a disease that was life threatening would you tell me the same thing??? I will never again take my son to this clinic again I am transferring him back to the other doctor.

I called twice after that and they said my contacts are ready. I drive there and it's not the contact I need! So I ask them please order them. 1 month later I call them back!

Apparently he was correct as he did not need to perform surgery and fixed the problem. My problem wasn't cancer, but her lack of thoroughness for her specialty which is colorectal surgery could have proved quite dangerous to me. Then their billing clerk Kim failed to post my payment on the day of service and sent me an invoice. Tried to call her by had to leave a message that she never returned. When 3 weeks later I finally was able to call and she answered the phone, it appeared she just ignored my call. It took her 30 seconds to find and fix her mistake all the while blaming me.

Sometimes the wait can be long but I don't mind. I rather have a doctor that takes their time with patients by answering questions, etc... then just rushing through appointments. Thus I never feel rushed during my appointment. Most of the staff that I have encountered have been friendly and helpful. PA, Tessa is also awesome! She is very nice and caring. She talks me through every step of my examination and makes me feel comfortable. She makes my 3 month check-ups less scary which is a good thing because I will be coming here for awhile. Thank you to everyone at the Women's Cancer Center of Nevada.\n",

      "       Wow! I checked these reviews, after my visit unfortunately, certain that they would be extremely positive and that I had it all wrong. Well, apparently not and I would just say these reviews speak for themselves, mirror my experience, and should serve as a strong caution to would be patients. I saw Dr. Browder for a consultation and was blown away by the lack of regard for what I was going through. I am certain my issue was not as serious as many she may see, but it was a post-surgical issue so there certainly was a legitimate issue to discuss. Like other reviewers, I would note: I waited almost 90 minutes from arrival to seeing the doctor who then visited for maybe two mintues tops - where she was extremely dismissive of my issue, allowed almost no time for questions, and get this at around the two minute mark actually hussled me out of the exam room! The knowledge of staff here may or may not be impressive, I could not say given the very little time I was allowed for my appointment and complete lack of empathy I encountered. But medicine is at its core a human function and humanity is sorely lacking here. I would recommend you literally go anywhere else and I say that realizing there is certainly a local lack of specialists to see in this particular area.\n",

They are very rude at the front desk and I almost feel like they're talking down to me!... I don't like them, not one little bit. I do like the doctor, except that she did NOT go over the pros/cons of taking the ovaries or not during a hysterectomy. Big oversight I think.\n",

      "       I took my Mom to see Dr. Aimee Fleury to further discuss her endometrial cancer. After waiting for 45 minutes for the doctor, I asked how long she would be. Someone from her staff annoying responded with \"in 5-10 minutes\". So 20 minutes later she rushes into the door, skimming through 20 pages of previous doctor notes for my mother, does a 3 minute exam and says she'll return. She then goes to see 2 other patients. When she comes back she orders a bunch of tests to be done and sends us off. After experiencing some issues with insurance, I contacted her to see if she could do a hysterectomy if we paid in cash. She refused, saying she \"wouldn't operate without a tissue diagnosis but i could come into her office to discuss it further\". My complaints: 1st - unprofessional office, someone should have told us upon arrival that there would be a wait since the Dr was running late. 2nd - cancer and someone's life is a delicate matter therefore you should take the time to review provided documentation as well as speak with each of your patients, addressing their concerns without them feeling rushed. 3rd - why would we spend another $80 copay to see you, if you aren't willing to do the procedure? I'm not sure if you had a bad day or perhaps you're in the wrong field. Our experience with you was disheartening and the only good thing about your office was Nilca. She displayed what you should have......patience and compassion!!\n",

      "       Writing for my wife, Bridget: HealthCare Partners approves my PCP referrals for United Healthcare Medicare Complete HMO. HealthCare Partners sent me to Women's Cancer Center of Nevada, 3131 La Canada Street, Suite 241, Las Vegas, where I was supposed to have a genetics test. They would not see me because I would not provide my social security number. I explained to them that twice before my social security number was hacked, both times due to medical. It cost us time, effort, and money to get it squared away. They didn't care. I asked them if they saw patients who are not U.S. citizens who don't have social security numbers ? They said they did but we require your S.S.#. The Social Security Administration says not to give out your number unless they pay you on which you would have to pay income taxes. They have no right to my social security number and I strongly suggest you straighten them out about this. They wouldn't see me so I left.\n",

      "       Let me start by saying that I'm used to paying $30-$40 for Brazilian laser hair removal sessions (often with $10 add ons underarms or anus) so when I got back to Canada from Australia and was quoted $170 per session I was like \"wait I'm sorry what the actual duck?\" - and yes I auto corrected on purpose for all your pretty little eyes. Then I found YS on Groupon which works out to around $40 for a medium area session ($200-$220 for the Groupon then tax is paid at the salon). Even without the Groupon, their prices are very reasonable and it's right by Lawrence train station so it's pretty convenient. Yuliya is super sweet and you immediately feel comfortable with her even though she's about to put a machine into your bits and pieces. She includes the anus with the Brazilian which is another bonus...am I allowed to say anus this many times in a review? The salon itself has a boutique feel to it, it's not like something you'd find at a 5 Star hotel or anything but it's comfortable and priced accordingly. I've only had one session but her machines seem good. It hurt a little more than Australia but only while it was happening, there's no pain after.\n",

Its so nicely decorated and everything is so neat. thank you so much yuliya, your AMAZING!! I' definitely recommend this place\n",

The reviews were all five stars, so I decided to go for it. I've now seen Yuliya for microdermabrasion and IPL and I will never go anywhere else. My skin a brighter and clearer than it's ever been. She is a pro in every sense -- so intelligent, experienced and passionate about what she does. Not to mention, Yuliya is honest and totally not in it for the up-sell. When I express an interest in a service she doesn't think will bring me great results, she's forthcoming about it. I'm so thrilled that I found this place. I'm a client for life!\n",

Thankfully, Yuliya is absolutely amazing- she has 10+ years of experience and is honest about what to expect. She made sure to describe the procedure and to outline the aftercare BEFORE I committed to the procedure. During the procedure she was constantly checking if I was comfortable and explaining what she was doing. She is very friendly and professional. Unlike other estheticians, she also doesn't forcibly sell you products but instead recommends things you can easily get over the counter. Best part- her prices are absolutely outrageous. I have yet to find anything better. I would absolutely recommend her services and I cannot wait to go back. I have only done one session but am happy so far- will likely update this review once they are done!\n",

There is NEVER a wait (I have been here three times in the past 2 months, both my friends have had appointments, and there have never been any waits for longer than 5 minutes) 2. They have ODA pricing which is what most dental plans will cover. Despite the fact that this office is in Toronto, there is no random other superficial up-charges for normal services. (This was the main reason I initially chose this dentist). 3. They do an excellent job! My teeth were cleaned really well, the hygienist (who's name escapes me, but she was fantastic) was so friendly. They also run specials and promos (I got my annual exam and teeth cleaning and they threw in a free whitening session). 4. Appointments are super easy and correspondence is super quick! Their secretary Stacey does a great job to help fit appointments in ASAP and at times that work for you. 5. They have after work and weekend hours! I have officially made the switch to this super convenient and awesome dental office!\n",

They clearly focus on your best interest, and not trying to make a quick buck from their patients. Location is very convenient too, right by Union Station and close to work for those in the Financial district. Also, they are very punctual and don't keep you waiting and wasting your time like other clinics. I would highly recommend them to anyone in the area.\n",

I heard her literally yelling at whoever's on the other end, very rude and unprofessional. I walked to the cash register to be checked out, where she finally saw me and got off the phone.

Because if you eat right, isn't that the most natural way to eat? The sales staff, like others have said, go on and on about the benefits of different products. As a pharmacist, I found it odd to watch the sales person try to describe absorption when she just isn't trained to do that. I find the whole experience a little uncomfortable. So, now I'm going online to try to find some more natural shampoos and soaps. Yes, I do like some things that are 'natural', but in the end, Death is natural, so give me the chemicals, if i need them.\n",
